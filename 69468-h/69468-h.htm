</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THE following essays, mainly concerned with
famous and familiar names, are less heterogeneous,
and it is hoped less hackneyed, than
some of the titles may suggest. They are all
occupied ultimately with some aspect of a single
problem in what I would call the psychology
of poetic experience, did not the phrase imply
a scientific rigour of method hardly as yet
achieved, in this region, by psychological science
itself, and in any case beyond the reach of
the present writer. How is the gift of imaginative
creation affected by the presence in the
same mind of one or other of the spiritual
energies which have a different, even an alien,
perhaps incompatible, aim or goal; or simply
by a bias of ingrained ethical habitudes or
ideals? What terms does poetry make with philosophy,
or religion, or patriotism, or politics, or
love, when one of these is urgent, also, in the
mind of a poet? I say ‘terms’ advisedly, for
nothing is more certain than that the outcome is
determined by a process of give and take. Every
complex experience involves a certain compromise
among its disparate or contending factors; a
compromise in great part, indeed, involuntary,
resulting from the fact that, even in the least<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
integrated personalities, the field of consciousness
is a continuous unity, into which no fresh element
enters without modifying, and being itself modified
by, the rest. In the class of cases with which we
are here concerned the modification may be loss
or gain, or both together. We think of Dante or
Lucretius as great philosophical poets, and many
people assume, because there are <i>longueurs</i> in the
<i>Paradiso</i>, and tough blocks of versified mechanics
in the <i>De Rerum Natura</i>, that these great poets
would have produced better poems had they
pursued poetry ‘for its own sake.’ What is
certain is that, without the passion for truth,
without the passionate desire to understand the
universe, without, too, the missionary passion to
save souls by communicating their own uplifting
and fortifying faith, each would have been less
occasionally tedious, doubtless, but also would have
missed some of those heights in poetry which they
in fact achieved. A chorus of critics denounce
the ‘didactic poem,’ and clearly the impulse to
instruct is more likely to act as slag than as fuel
upon the flame of poetic creation. But the prophet
is only the schoolmaster writ large, and <i>vates</i> is one
of the oldest names of the poet. Matthew Arnold
made fun of the educational theorizing in <i>The
Excursion</i>, but no one better understood the
grandeur of Wordsworth the prophet, and he and
Goethe are doubtless chiefly accountable for the
Arnoldian definition of poetry as ‘criticism of
life.’</p>

<p>Analogous problems are touched in the essays on
Keats and on d’Annunzio. These two very dissimilar
poets, both recently invested with topical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
interest by the hazards of a centenary and of a political
adventure, have this in common, that into the
life of both came, at a certain moment, an experience
of grandeur, which told decisively, though in
utterly different ways, upon the scale and contents
of their imaginative vision. Keats in 1818 for the
first time looked upon ‘grand mountains’ (his
own phrase); d’Annunzio, in the early nineties,
was captivated by the Nietzschean revelation of
the Superman. Upon Keats, the effect, complicated
as we know, with other influences, was
wholly astringent and bracing; it concurred with
the strenuous art of Milton to wean him from the
‘luxury’ of his earlier song and inspire the
colossal imaginings of <i>Hyperion</i>. Upon d’Annunzio
the effect was less entirely happy. The fiery
declamations of the Destroyer (as his Italian
disciple called Nietzsche), who aspired to rear an
ideally potent and perfect race upon the ruins
of present-day humanity, enlarged his intellectual
horizons and quickened his patriotic ambition, but
also tinged his thinking and his action, whether
as a poet or as a publicist, henceforth, with a
megalomania hazardous for him in both capacities.</p>

<p>Shakespeare may seem to offer little foothold for
this kind of study, or at least to illustrate aspects
of it too familiar to be discussed. No one now
imagines him a passionless artist, holding up the
mirror to a world in which he had no further
concern. He was in any case a devoted lover of
his country, and patriotism contributed vitally to
the making of one, not the least splendid or
memorable, division of his drama. National pride
has occasionally impaired the poetry of the English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
Histories, though the vulgar Joan of Arc scenes in
1 <i>Henry VI</i> be no misdeed of his; it has again and
again caught the poet up to towering heights. But
in some other, perhaps less obvious, ways Shakespeare’s
mentality, as we divine it, seems to stand
in a like double relation to his poetry; here tributory
and creative, there, if not impairing its quality,
limiting its scope. With all his apparent spontaneity,
and the thousand unblotted lines which
astonished his editors and offended Ben, he was
hardly pure poet, hardly ‘of imagination all compact’;
the man of ‘sovran alchemy’ had his share
of the still untransmuted stuff. His poetry, compared
with Spenser’s or Shelley’s, is in intimate
touch with fact, far richer and deeper than theirs,
but also nearer to the temper which is the negation
of poetry. His glorious humanity is not without
preferences and exclusions; and these are largely
of a kind which he shares with the respectable
citizen rather than with the finer and rarer spirits.
He has not Browning’s taste for eccentric or
exceptional types, his interest is not on the
dangerous edge of things; and if each of his great
creations is in some sense unique, they are rich
beyond all others in traits which make them seem
our kin. He unmistakably prefers order to turmoil;
‘degree, priority and place’ to the romance and
heroics of revolution; observance of custom, other
things being the same, to the breach of it; the
normal to the irregular. His temperament was
thus of a type which has affinities with some great
and with some less estimable things: it is allied
on the one side to the noble harmonies and symmetries
of classical art, on the other to unreflecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
habit and dull routine. It is the aim of the
opening essay to trace the effects of what I may
then call Shakespeare’s bias for <i>normality</i> in a
single sphere of his art—his treatment of Love and
Marriage. His ideal of love is a state in which
passion and sense and intellect are united in happy
balance, and we owe to it a series of creations of
incomparable loveliness, from Rosalind and Portia
to Imogen and Perdita. But it is plain that Shakespeare
has sounded only a few notes of the gamut
of love poetry. He gives us a few exquisite simple
melodies; he rarely hints its complex music, the
difficult harmonies extorted from dissonance and
conflict. He rather conspicuously avoids, save for
special dramatic purposes, irregular, illicit, or
criminal passion. It is not merely accident or
stage fashion that has prevented our having from
Shakespeare more than occasional approximations
to a Vittoria Corombona or a Francesca da Rimini,
a Gretchen or a Rebekka West.</p>

<p>The fifth essay, finally, asks a question which
may appear futile, or academic, but at least arises
very naturally for the student in this field. Does
the creative activity of poetry, so readily fed and
fanned, or obstructed and impaired, by philosophical
or religious preoccupation, itself react upon the
poet’s beliefs, his outlook upon the world, in any
definable way? We may be inclined to reply, with
the young Tennyson, that the poet stands apart
from beliefs, ‘holding no form of creed, but contemplating
all’; or to object, on the contrary, that
poets are the most sensitive of men, apt to be
rather less than others exempt from subjection to
the idols of their place and time. Certainly there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
is no ‘poet’s creed.’ But there may be a common
bent or bias which poetic creation tends to impress
upon creeds and convictions otherwise derived; and
a survey of the modifications actually undergone
by philosophies and theologies in the crucible of
poetry suggests that this bent will be towards the
faith which, in one guise or another, exalts the
place and function of spirit in the universe, and in
the last resort finds in spiritual energy the heart
of reality.</p>

SHAKESPEARE’S TREATMENT

<p>I</p>

<p class="noin"><b>SHAKESPEARE’S TREATMENT
OF LOVE AND MARRIAGE</b></p>
</div>

<p class="drop-capi">THE Shakesperean world is impressed, as a
whole, with an unmistakable joy in healthy
living. This tells habitually as a pervading spirit,
a contagious temper, not as a creed put forward,
or an example set up. It is as clear in the presentment
of Falstaff or Iago, as of Horatio or Imogen.
And nowhere is it clearer than in his handling of
the relations between men and women. For here
Shakespeare’s preferences and repugnances are
unusually transparent; what pleased him in the
ways of lovers and wedded folks he drew again
and again, and what repelled him he rarely and
only for special reasons drew at all. Criminal
love, of any kind, holds a quite subordinate place
in his art; and, on the other hand, if ideal figures
are to be found there, it is among his devoted,
passionate, but arch and joyous women.</p>

<p>It is thus possible to lay down a Shakesperean
<i>norm</i> or ideal type of love-relations. It is most
distinct in the mature Comedies, where he is shaping
his image of life with serene freedom; but also
in the Tragedies, where a Portia or a Desdemona
innocently perishes in the web of death. Even in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
the Histories it occasionally asserts itself (as in
Richard II’s devoted queen, historically a mere
child) against the stress of recorded fact. In the
earlier Comedies it is approached through various
stages of erratic or imperfect forms. And both in
Comedy and Tragedy he makes use, though not
largely, of other than the ‘normal’ love for
definitely comic or tragic ends.</p>

<p>The present study will follow the plan thus
indicated. The first section defines the ‘norm.’
The second describes the kinds of appeal and
effect, in Comedy and Tragedy, to which the
drama of ‘normal’ love lent itself. The third
traces the gradual approach to the norm in the
early Comedies. The fourth and fifth sections,
finally, discuss the treatment, in Comedy and
Tragedy, of Love-types other than the norm.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The Shakesperean norm of love,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> thus understood,
may be described somewhat as follows.
Love is a passion, kindling heart, brain, and senses
alike in natural and happy proportions; ardent
but not sensual, tender but not sentimental, pure
but not ascetic, moral but not puritanic, joyous
but not frivolous, mirthful and witty but not
cynical. His lovers look forward to marriage as a
matter of course, and they neither anticipate its
rights nor turn their affections elsewhere. They
commonly love at first sight and once for all.
Love-relations which do not contemplate marriage
occur rarely and in subordination to other dramatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
purposes. Tragedy like that of Gretchen does
not attract him. Romeo’s amour with Rosalind is
a mere foil to his greater passion, Cassio’s with
Bianca merely a mesh in the network of Iago’s
intrigue; Claudio’s with Juliet is the indispensable
condition of the plot. The course of love rarely
runs smooth; but rival suitors proposed by parents
are quietly resisted or merrily abused, never, even
by the gentlest, accepted. Crude young girls like
Hermia, delicate-minded women like Desdemona
and Imogen, the rapturous Juliet and the homely
Anne Page, the discreet Silvia and the naïve
Miranda, are all at one on this point. And they all
carry the day. The dramatically powerful situations
which arise from forced marriage—as when Ford’s
Penthea (<i>The Broken Heart</i>) or Corneille’s Chimène
(<i>Le Cid</i>) is torn by the conflict between love and
honour—lie, like this conflict in general, outside
Shakespeare’s chosen field. And with this security
of possession his loving women combine a capacity
for mirth and jest not usual in the dramatic
representation of passion. Rosalind is more intimately
Shakesperean than Juliet.</p>

<p>Married life, as Shakespeare habitually represents
it, is the counterpart, <i>mutatis mutandis</i>, of his
representation of unmarried lovers. His husbands
and wives have less of youthful abandon; they
rarely speak of love, and still more rarely with lyric
ardour, or coruscations of poetic wit. But they
are no less true. The immense field of dramatic
motives based upon infringements of marriage, so
fertile in the hands of his successors, and in most
other schools of drama, did not attract Shakespeare,
and he touched it only occasionally and for particular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
purposes. Heroines like Fletcher’s Evadne
(<i>A Maid’s Tragedy</i>), who marries a nominal husband
to screen her guilty relations with the King, or
Webster’s Vittoria Corombona (<i>The White Devil</i>),
who conspires with her lover to murder her husband,
or Chapman’s Tamyra (<i>Bussy d’Ambois</i>), whose
husband kills her lover in her chamber; even
Heywood’s erring wife, whom her husband elects
to ‘kill with kindness,’ are definitely un-Shakesperean.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The norm of love lent itself both to comic and to
tragic situation, but only within somewhat narrow
limits. The richness, depth and constancy of the
passion precluded a whole world of comic effects.
It precluded the comedy of the coquette and the
prude, of the affected gallant and the cynical roué,
of the calf-lover and the doting husband; the
comedy of the fantastic tricks played by love under
the obsession of pride, self-interest, meticulous
scruple, or superstition. Into this field Shakespeare
made brilliant incursions, but it hardly engaged his
rarest powers, and to large parts of it his ‘universal’
genius remained strange. We have only
to recall, among a crowd of other examples, Moreto’s
Diana (<i>El Desden con el Desden</i>), Molière’s Alceste
and Célimène, Congreve’s Millamant, in Shakespeare’s
century; or, in the modern novel, a long
line of figures from Jane Austen to <i>The Egoist</i>
and Ibsen’s <i>Love’s Comedy</i>—to recognize that
Shakespeare, with all the beauty, wit and charm
of his work, touched only the fringes of the Comedy
of love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span></p>

<p>The normal love, not being itself ridiculous,
could thus yield material for the comic spirit only
through some fact or situation external to it.
It may be brought before us only in ludicrous
parody. We laugh at the ‘true love’ of Pyramus
and Thisbe in the ‘tedious brief’ play of the
Athenian artisans, or at that of Phœbe and
Silvius, because Shakespeare is chaffing the literary
pastoral of his day. Hamlet’s love, itself moving,
even tragic, becomes a source of comedy in the
solemn analysis of Polonius. Or again, the source
of fun lies in the wit and humour of the lovers
themselves. Some of them, like Rosalind and
Beatrice, virtually create and sustain the wit-fraught
atmosphere of the play single-handed.
But Shakespeare habitually heightens this source
of fun by some piquancy of situation—almost
always one arising from delusion, particularly
through confusion of identity. It is a mark of
the easy-going habits of his art in comedy that he
never threw aside this rather elementary device,
though subjecting it, no doubt, to successive
refinements which become palpable enough when
we pass from the <i>Two Gentlemen</i> to <i>Cymbeline</i>.
But his genius made perennially delightful even
the crude forms of confusion which create
grotesque infatuations like those of Titania, Malvolio,
Phœbe, Olivia. More refined, and yet more
delightful, are the confusions which bring true
and destined lovers together, like the arch make-believe
courtship with which Rosalind’s wit amuses
and consoles her womanhood, and that other which
liberates the natural congeniality of Beatrice and
Benedict from their ‘merry war.’ In cases like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
these, Shakespeare’s humour has the richer and
finer effluence which derives from a hidden ground
of passion or tears. Rosalind’s wit is that of a
woman many fathoms deep in love; Beatrice’s
ears tingle with remorse at the tale of Benedick’s
secret attachment; Viola’s gallant bravado to
Olivia conceals her own unspoken maiden love.
And Portia crowns her home-coming to her husband
and her splendid service to his friend with the
madcap jest of the rings. Such jesting is in
Shakespeare a part of the language of love; and
like its serious or lyrical speech, is addressed with
predilection to love’s object.</p>

<p>Again, the normal love offered in itself equally
little promise of tragedy. No deformed or morbid
passion, but the healthy and natural self-fulfilment
of man and woman, calling heart and wit and
senses alike into vigorous play, it provided equally
little hold for the criminal erotics in which most
of Shakespeare’s contemporaries sought the tragic
thrill, and for the bitter disenchantment and
emotional decay which generate the subtle tragedy
of <i>Anna Karénina</i> or <i>Modern Love</i>. Tragic these
healthy lovers of themselves will never become;
they have to be led into the realm of pity and
fear, as into that of laughter and mirth, by the
incitement or the onthrust of alien forces. Here,
too, Shakespeare’s habitual instrument is delusion;
only now it is not the delusion which deftly
entangles and pleasantly infatuates, but that which
horribly perplexes and rends apart. The blindness,
of Claudio, of Othello, of Posthumus, of Leontes,
is provoked by circumstances of very various
cogency, but in each case it wrecks a love relation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
in which we are allowed to see no flaw. The
situation of innocent, slandered, heart-stricken
womanhood clearly appealed strongly to him, and
against his wont he repeated it again and again.
Even after leaving the stage, he was allured by
the likeness of the story of Henry VIII’s slandered
queen to his Hermione, to reopen the magic ‘book’
he had ‘drowned.’ He was no sentimentalist;
his pathos is never morbid; but it is in imagining
souls of texture fine and pure enough to be wrought
upon to the most piteous extreme by slander from
the man they love, that Shakespeare found most
of his loveliest and most authentically Shakesperean
characters of women. Hermione and Hero,
Desdemona and Imogen, are to his graver art
what Rosalind and Beatrice and Portia are to his
comedy.</p>

<p>But while the tragic issue is directly provoked
by the alien intervention, it is clear that almost
all its tragic quality springs, not from the operations
of Iachimo or Iago, but from the wonderful presentment
of the love they wreck. Shakespeare’s supreme
command of pity springs from his exalted faith in
love. The poet of the Sonnets is implicit in the
poet of <i>Othello</i>. And the dramas themselves abound
in lyric outbursts, often hardly called for by the
situation, in which his ideal of wedded love is
uttered with the poignant insight of one who was
probably far from having achieved or observed it
himself. One need but think of France’s reply to
Burgundy (<i>King Lear</i>, I, i. 241):</p>

<p>The husband in these cases, it is true, neither
forgives nor condones, and Shakespeare (unlike
Heywood) gives no hint that he would have
dissented from the traditional ethics on which
Othello and Posthumus and Leontes acted, had
their wives in fact been guilty. The wives, on
the other hand, encounter the husband’s unjust
suspicions, or brutal slanders, without a thought

<p>In one drama only did he represent ideal love
brought to a tragic doom without a hint of inner
severance. The wedded unity of Romeo and
Juliet is absolute from their first meeting to their
last embrace; it encounters only the blind onset
of outer and irrelevant events; nothing touches
their rapturous faith in one another. This earliest
of the authentic tragedies thus represents, in
comparison with its successors, only an elementary
order of tragic experience; set beside <i>Othello</i>, it
appears to be not a tragedy of love, but love’s
triumphal hymn. Yet it is only in this sense
immature. If Shakespeare had not yet fathomed
the depths of human misery, he understood completely
the exaltation of passion, and <i>Romeo and
Juliet</i>, though it gives few glimpses beyond the
horizons of his early world, remains the consummate
flower of his poetry of ideal love.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The beauty and insight of Shakespeare’s finest
portrayals of the comedy and the tragedy of love
were not reached at once. His conception of love
itself was still, at the opening of his career,
relatively slight and superficial; his mastery of
technique was equally incomplete. The early plays
accordingly abound with scenes and situations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
where from either cause or both the dramatic
treatment of love is not yet in the full sense
Shakesperean. It will suffice in this sketch to
specify two types of each.</p>

<p>The young Shakespeare, as is well known, showed
a marked leaning to two apparently incongruous
kinds of dramatic device—paradox and symmetry.
In the riotous consciousness of power he loved
to take up the challenge of outrageous situations,
to set himself dramaturgical problems,
which he solves by compelling us to admit that
the impossible might have happened in the way
he shows. A shrew to be ‘tamed’ into a model
wife. A widow following her murdered father’s
coffin, to be wooed, there and then, and won, by
his murderer. A girl of humble birth, in love
with a young noble who scorns her, to set herself,
notwithstanding, to win him, and to succeed.
Paradoxical feats like these were foreign to the
profound normality—under whatever romantic disguise—of
Shakespeare’s mature art. Richard and
Petruchio and Helen carry into the problems of
love-making the enterprising audacity of the young
Shakespeare in the problems of art. But the
audacity of the young Shakespeare showed itself in
another way. His so-called taste for ‘symmetry’
had nothing in common with the classical canons
of balance and order. It was nearer akin to the
boyish humour of mimicry. If he found a pair
of indistinguishable twins producing amusing confusion
in a Roman play, he capped them with a
second pair, to produce confusion worse confounded
in the English <i>Comedy of Errors</i>. And so with
love. Navarre (in <i>Love’s Labour’s Lost</i>) and his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
three lords, like the four horses of an antique
quadriga, go through the same adventure side by
side. All four have forsworn the sight of women;
all four fall in love, not promiscuously but in
order of rank, with the French princess and her
ladies, whose numbers, by good fortune, precisely
go round.</p>

<p>But love itself is not, as yet, drawn with any
power. Berowne’s magnificent account of its attributes
and effects (IV, iii., mainly re-written in 1597)
is not borne out by any representation of it in the
play. The ‘taffeta phrases’ and ‘silken terms
precise,’ the pointed sallies and punning repartees,
full of a hard crackling gaiety, neither express
passion nor suggest, like the joyous quips of the
later Rosalind, that passion is lurking behind. We
are spectators of a rather protracted flirtation, a
‘way of love’ which was to occupy a minimal
place in his later drama. Armado’s dramatically
unimportant seduction of Jaquenetta is likewise
a symptom of his ‘apprentice’ phase.</p>

<p>Equally immature is the representation of fickle
love in the <i>Two Gentlemen</i>. Proteus is Shakespeare’s
only essay in the Don Juan type, but it falls far
short in psychological and dramatic force of his
portrait of the faithful Julia. Proteus’s speeches
are often rhetorical analyses of his situation rather
than dramatic expressions of it. His threat to
outrage Sylvia (V, iv. 58) is, as he naively declares,
‘’gainst the nature of love,’ and it clashed no less
violently with Shakespeare’s rendering of the passion
elsewhere. Even the apparent fickleness produced
by delusion flourishes only in the magical world
of the young Shakespeare’s Midsummer Dream.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
The inconstancy of the Athenian lovers attests
only the potency of the faery juice. No doubt
Shakespeare’s denouements, even in some of the
maturest comedies, show his lovers accepting with
a singular facility a fate in love other than that
they had chosen. Olivia accepts Sebastian in
default of Viola, and the Duke Viola when Olivia
is out of the question. Still less defensible
artistically is Isabel’s renunciation of the convent
to marry the Duke. But these acquiescences, even
if they were not touched with the frequent perfunctoriness
of Shakespeare’s finales, are not to be
classed with deliberate inconstancy.</p>

<p>A second mark of unripeness in the conception
of love <span class="err" title="original: as">is</span> extravagant magnanimity. This, like
other kinds of unnatural virtue, was a part of the
heritage from mediæval romance, fortified with
Roman legend. The antique exaltation of friendship
concurred with the Germanic absoluteness of
faithful devotion, and for the mediæval mind the
most convincing way of attesting this was by the
surrender of a mistress. In the tenth book of the
<i>Decamerone</i> Boccaccio collects the most admired
examples of ‘things done generously and magnificently,’
chiefly in matters of love; one of them
is the tale of Tito and Gisippo (<i>Decamerone</i>, X, 8),
where, Tito having fallen in love with his friend’s
bride, Gisippo ‘generously’ resigns to him all
but the name of husband. The story, quoted in
Sir T. Elyot’s <i>Governour</i> (1531), was well known
in Elizabethan England, and fell in with the
fantastical world of Fletcher’s Romanticism. But
the humanity and veracity of the mature Shakespeare
rejected these extravagances as the cognate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
genius of the mature Chaucer had done before
him. Chaucer lived to mock at the legendary
magnanimity of Griselda, so devoutly related in
the <i>Clerkes Tale</i>; and it was only the young
Shakespeare who could have made Valentine’s
astounding offer, in the <i>Two Gentlemen</i>, to resign
‘all his rights’ in his bride to the ‘friend’ from
whose offer of violence he has only a moment
before rescued her (V, vi. 83).<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>A second variety of extravagant magnanimity
was the recurring situation of the girl, who, deserted
by her lover, follows him in disguise, takes service
as his page, and in that capacity is employed by
him to further his suit to a new mistress. This
motive was of the purest romantic lineage; having
first won vogue in Europe through Montemayor’s
<i>Diana</i> (1558, trans. 1588), and in England by
Sidney’s <i>Arcadia</i> (1581, publ. 1590). On the
London stage it profited by the special piquancy
attaching to the rôles of girls in masculine disguise
when the actors were boys, and its blend of
audacious adventure and devoted self-sacrifice gave
the Elizabethan auditor precisely the kind of composite
thrill he loved.</p>

<p>For some forms of sex-confusion Shakespeare
throughout his career retained an unmistakable
liking. But the finer instincts of his ripening art<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
gradually restricted its scope. Viola, in the original
story (Bandello, II, 36) follows a faithless lover;
in <i>Twelfth Night</i>, wrecked on the Illyrian coast, she
disguises herself merely for safety, takes service
with the Duke as a complete stranger, and only
subsequently falls in love with him. The change
indicates with precision Shakespeare’s attitude at
this date (<i>c.</i> 1600) to this type of situation. He
was still quite ready to exploit the rather elementary
comedy arising out of sex-confusion—to
paint with gusto Viola’s embarrassments as the
object of Olivia’s passion and Sir Andrew’s challenge,
or the brilliant pranks of Rosalind in a like
position. But he would not now approach these
situations by the romantic avenue of a love-sick
woman’s pursuit. In his latest plays he shows
disrelish even for the delightful fun evolved from
sex-confusion in <i>Twelfth Night</i> and <i>As you like it</i>.
The adventures of Imogen in disguise are purely
pathetic. Pisanio indeed proposes, and Imogen
agrees, to follow her husband to Italy in disguise;
but this opening is significantly not followed up.
(<i>Cymbeline</i>, III, iv. 150 f.)</p>

<p>But in the <i>Two Gentlemen</i>, the entire motive
without curtailment or qualification is presented in
the adventures of Julia. Abandoned by Proteus,
she follows him in disguise, takes service as his
page, and is employed as go-between in his new
courtship of Silvia. To the young Shakespeare the
situation was still wholly congenial, and he availed
himself of its opportunities of pathos without
reserve, though with incomplete power. His riper
technique, fortified probably by a closer acquaintance
with the spirited and high-bred womanhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
of the Portias and Rosalinds of his time, withdrew
his interest, perhaps his belief, from the risky
psychology of Julia’s self-assertion and self-abnegation.
Like other strained situations suggested
by ‘golden tongued romance,’ it fell
away before the consolidated experience, the
genial worldliness, the poetized normality, of his
riper art.</p>

<p>The case of another devoted pursuer of an
unwilling man is more complicated, and calls for
closer examination. <i>All’s Well That Ends Well</i> has
already been referred to as an example of the
paradox-plotting congenial to the young Shakespeare.
But Helena’s passion and her sacrifices for
the man whose love she seeks ally her also with
the Julia type. Yet internal evidence leaves no
doubt that this play, though originally written,
and therefore planned, in the early nineties, was
revised by Shakespeare at a date not far remote
from that of Hamlet. If the paradox-subject was
the apprentice’s eager choice, the artist at the
height of his power did not reject its challenge. In
the original story (<i>Decamerone</i>, III, 9) the flavour
of paradox was even more pronounced. Like the
other tales of the Third Day, it describes one who
<i>alcuna cosa molto da lui desiderata con industria
acquistasse</i>. Giletta of Narbonne succeeds in effect
by sheer audacity and enterprise; and Boccaccio’s
readers doubtless enjoyed this inversion of the
usual rôles, where a masterful girl captures a
reluctant man. Shakespeare’s earlier version was
probably the lost <i>Love’s Labour’s Won</i> mentioned
by Meres, and the title emphasizes the element of
resolute and unhesitating pursuit which marks the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
original, and was probably more pronounced in
the earlier than in the revised play.</p>

<p>For it is plain that precisely the resolute pursuit
of a resisting man was uncongenial to Shakespeare’s
riper art, because unnatural in the type of high-bred
and refined womanhood whose ways in love
reflected his ideal of healthy love-making. Helena,
as the heroine and predominant figure of the play,
had to be of the sisterhood of Portia and Rosalind
and Beatrice and Viola. But if the plot forbad
this? And clearly, the most hazardous incident
of all (the substitution of Helen for Diana) could
not be eliminated without breaking up the plot
altogether. Why then take up the old play at
all? Plainly there must have been in the fundamental
theme something which Shakespeare was
unwilling to lose as well as something that he
would have wished away. This something that
attracted him was evidently Helen’s clear-sighted
resolution in itself; in this she is, in fact, a true
sister of Portia and Rosalind, though her seriousness
is not, like theirs, irradiated with laughter. Could
she be visibly endowed with this grace of clear
sight and will, yet at the same time be rather
drawn on by circumstances to the final conquest
of Bertram than herself the active agent in it?
Somewhat thus must the problem have presented
itself to Shakespeare. Did he completely solve it?
I think not. But we can to some extent follow
his procedure.</p>

<p>Strength and delicacy are from the first blended
in Helen. Her famous lines (I, i. 231):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Which we ascribe to heaven.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span></p>
<p class="noin">strike the keynote of her resolute temper. Yet
her love, a maiden’s idolatry, is content without
possession; with her, ‘Dian’ is ‘both herself and
love’ (I, iii. 218). If she forms plans for showing
her merit and thus commending herself in Bertram’s
eyes, she takes no step herself; it is the Countess
who, having discovered her love, welcomes her
prospective daughter-in-law and sends her with all
proper convoy to court to ‘cure the king.’ Her
choosing of Bertram (II, iii. 109) is an offer of
life-long service, not the appropriation of a well-won
prize. And when Bertram bluntly declares
that he ‘cannot love her nor will strive to do it,’
she proposes, turning to the king, to withdraw
her whole claim:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">That you are well restored, my lord, I’m glad;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Let the rest go.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The crucial situation, however, for her (and for
Shakespeare) begins only with Bertram’s definite
departure, and scornful intimation of the conditions
on which he will be her husband. Giletta, on
receiving the corresponding message, had made
up her mind at once what to do; had arranged
her affairs and set out on the <i>soi-disant</i> pilgrimage
to Florence, where Beltramo she knows will be
found. Helena’s procedure is less clear. Two
distinct courses were open to her. She might,
like Giletta, make direct for Bertram at Florence,
under the pretext of going on a pilgrimage. Or she
might finally surrender the pursuit of a husband
who had decisively shown he did not love her, as
she had already proposed to do when he had only
declared that he did not. The second was unquestionably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
more in keeping with Helen’s character.
But the first was more in keeping with the plot.
It might well be that Shakespeare’s Helen would
hesitate between the two. But it is in any case
probable that Shakespeare hesitated, and that
the marks of his hesitation have not been effaced
from the text.</p>

<p>On reading Bertram’s letter she is, like Imogen
when she reads Posthumus’s, for the moment
overwhelmed. ‘This is a dreadful sentence.’ She
hardly speaks, and gives no hint to the Countess
of her thoughts. But when she is alone she breaks
out in the great passionate monologue of renunciation
(III, ii. 102 f.)....</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">No, come thou home, Rousillon,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">As oft it loses all: I will be gone;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">My being here it is that holds thee hence:</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall I stay here to do’t? no, no, although</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The air of paradise did fan the house,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And angels office’d all: I will be gone....</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This can only imply, since she is alone, that she
sincerely proposes to give up all claim to her
nominal husband.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in Scene iv., the Countess is seen
reading a letter from Helen which declares that she
has gone as a pilgrim to Saint Jaques, in Florence.
She begs the Countess, it is true, to summon Bertram
home to live there in peace while she in the far
land does penance for her ‘ambitious love.’ Was
this a subterfuge, like Giletta’s, or was it her
sincere intention as we should infer from the
previous monologue? If it is the first, Helena
comes nearer to the crafty duplicity of Giletta
than anywhere else in the play, and this towards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
the Countess who has just indignantly renounced
her stubborn son, and taken Helena to her heart
as her sole child (III, ii. 71). But if it is the second,
we cannot but ask why then, if Helena means
<i>bona fide</i> to avoid Bertram and leave him free,
she chooses for her pilgrimage precisely the one
place in the world in which she knows he will be
found? And this awkward question remains un-answered,
notwithstanding the evident effort to
allow us to believe in Helena’s innocent good faith.
Giletta, on arriving at Florence, takes up her
abode at an inn, ‘eager to hear news of her lord.’
Helena arrives, apparently concerned only to learn
the way to St. Jacques, and where the pilgrims
bound thither found lodging. Then Bertram is mentioned;
she learns that he is known, and has made
advances to Diana; presently he passes by, and
now at length Helen deliberately and unhesitatingly
takes measures to fulfil his ‘impossible’ conditions.</p>

<p>Helena’s conduct appears, then, to fluctuate,
without clear explanation, between resolute pursuit
and dignified renunciation.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the former type of
procedure represents the earlier, the latter the
riper, mind of Shakespeare, in the treatment of
love. The letter to the Countess, of III, iv., is,
like all his verse-letters, early work; the great
preceding monologue is in the richly imaginative
phrase and daringly yet harmoniously moulded
verse of the Hamlet period. He set out to fit a
character based upon a nobler type of love into
a plot based upon a grosser; and even he could
not effect this without some straining of the
stuff, and here and there a palpable rent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span></p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>What I have called the norm of love must
thus rank high among the determining forces of
his mature drama. Obscured and disguised at
the outset by crude conceptions and immature
technique, it gradually grew clear, and provided
the background of passion, faith, and truth out
of which, aided by misunderstandings, pleasant or
grave, his most delightful comedy and his most
poignant tragedy were evolved. And other types
of love—whether they made for comedy or for
tragedy, held a relatively slight place in his work.
In particular he concerns himself only in a quite
exceptional or incidental way either with the high
comedy of love or with guilty passion.</p>

<p>His comedy of love outside the norm for the
most part resembles burlesque. In other words,
the ‘ways of love’ which he treats as comic
material are not plausible or subtle approximations
to romantic passion, but ludicrously absurd counterfeits
of it. The fun is brilliant, but it does not
strike deep; it provokes the loud laugh rather
than the ‘slim feasting smile.’ It commonly
springs from some grotesque infatuation; as when,
in Bottom and Titania, human grossness and fairy
fantasticality are brought together for the eternal
joy of gods and men. Ridicule of such infatuations
was soon to find its peculiar home in the Humour
comedy of the later nineties, in the prosaic satirical
air of which the romantic or normal love had no
place at all. It is hardly an accident that the plays
in which this Shakesperean comedy of grotesque<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
infatuation in love runs riot were produced when the
Humour comedy was at the height of its vogue, or
that they bear clear traces of its influence. <i>Twelfth
Night</i> is far from being as a whole a Comedy of
Humours. Viola’s maiden passion is touched with
a charm wholly alien to it. The Duke, with his
opal and taffeta mind, a self-pleasing artist in
emotion, who feeds his languid passion on music,
and does his wooing by proxy, is perhaps Shakespeare’s
only serious study of love as a humour.
Of still more laughable futility is the love-making
of Malvolio, with his smiles and yellow stockings,
and Sir Andrew, who gets no further than learning
an assortment of fine words for an interview that
never comes off—a comic counterpart to Iago’s
miserable dupe, Roderigo. <i>The Merry Wives</i> also
shows the influence of the Humour comedy.
Slender is a true ‘country-gull,’ nowhere more
obviously than in his wooing, or preparations to
woo, sweet Anne Page. The adventures of Falstaff
in pursuit of Mrs. Ford and Mrs. Page are brilliantly
executed examples of a kind of comic effect
which Shakespeare’s riper art elsewhere disdained.
Officially required to represent ‘Falstaff in love,’
he turned the laugh against the lover by representing
his ill-luck in pursuing the only ‘way of love’
he knew.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>Finally, as Shakespeare recognized for purposes
of comedy certain types of love-making alien to
the ideal norm, so too, more rarely, for the purposes
of tragedy. Ideal love, as has been seen, occurs
constantly in the tragedies even where it does not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
directly affect or participate in the tragic issues;
as with France and Cordelia, Brutus and Portia,
Richard II and his queen, Coriolanus and Virgilia.
But the more penetrating sense of evil which
becomes apparent in his tragic period contributed
to draw more prominently into the sphere of his art
the disastrous aspects of the relations between men
and women. That he refrained from exploiting
in drama the more sinister forms of passion, we
have seen. But in some of his ripest and greatest
work he drew love with implications and under
conditions, which sharply mark it off from the
‘marriage of true minds.’ It is unstable, or
lawless, or grounded on illusion; and thus not
merely succumbs easily to assault from without,
but directly breeds and fosters tragic ruin within.
Even the union of Othello and Desdemona, in
every other respect a ‘marriage of true minds’
which reaches for a moment (ii. 1) incomparable
intensity and beauty, is rendered fatally precarious
by their ignorance of each other.</p>

<p>Love, like everything else which grows in Hamlet’s
Denmark, is touched with insidious disease.
Ophelia is wonderfully imagined in keeping with
the tragic atmosphere, an exquisite but fragile
flower of the unweeded garden where evil things
run to seed and good things wither. And her
love, wholly un-Shakesperean as it is, and therefore
irritating to many readers, bears within it
the seed of tragedy both for Hamlet and herself.
It is ‘a power girt round with weakness.’ She
never falters in faithful devotion to him; but
the ‘sweet bells,’ her father has told her, are
‘jangled,’ and she consents both to be the instrument<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>
of the king and Polonius’s ‘lawful espial’
(which may, please heaven, restore him), and to
deny his access and return his gifts. She stands
alone among Shakesperean heroines in renouncing
her love at a father’s bidding. We seem to
approach for once the heroic renunciations of love
in the name of principle or country which impress
us in Corneille and Racine—in <i>Polyeucte</i> or <i>Bérénice</i>.
But no halo of sublime self-sacrifice surrounds
Ophelia’s renunciation, for her or for us. It is
merely a piteous surrender, which breaks her
heart, overthrows her delicately poised reason, and
removes one of the last supports of Hamlet’s trust
in goodness.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Shakespeare occasionally
found his tragic love in violent and lawless passion.
We need not dwell on episodic incidents like the
rivalry in the love of Edmund which crowns and
closes the criminal careers of Goneril and Regan.
In this case there was little scope for the undoing
of soul which is the habitual theme of Shakesperean
tragedy. But in <i>Measure for Measure</i> an inrush of
sensual passion instantly shatters the imposing but
loosely built edifice of Angelo’s morality, and
though the play was meant for comedy, and the
tragic point is thus (rather clumsily) blunted or
broken off, the spiritual undoing of him is discernible
enough. Without a thought of resistance
he proceeds to act out the whole merciless catalogue
of vices which the poet of sonnet cxxix saw
attending upon lust.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> At the same time it is
clear that Isabel, with her cold austerity, is an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
even greater anomaly among Shakespeare’s women.
Their purity is not that of a negative abstinence,
but of whole-hearted devotion to the man they love.</p>

<p>In Cressida he drew a kind of tragic love as
lawless as Angelo’s and as sensual, but insidious
and seductive instead of violent. Compared with
the profligate women of Restoration Comedy she
has a certain girlish air of grace and innocence.
If she betrays Troilus for Diomede it is with a
sigh and a half wistful glance back at the deserted
lover: ‘Troilus, farewell! one eye yet looks on
thee’ (V, ii. 107). Though classed by the Folio
editors—hesitatingly it would seem—with the
Tragedies, this play seems to set at nought the
whole scheme of Shakesperean tragedy. Neither
Troilus nor Cressida has the grandeur without
which ruin is not sublime; and their love has not
the heroic intensity of those (like Heine’s <i>Asra</i>)
<i>welche sterben wenn sie lieben</i>. The only imposing
figures are those of the great captains of the Greek
and Trojan camps, who are but slightly concerned
with their love. Nevertheless, the whole effect of
the play is tragic, or falls short of tragedy only
because the gloom is more unrelieved. There are
no colossal disasters, plots, crimes, or suffering,
nor yet the stormy splendour which agony beats
out of the souls of Othello, Hamlet, Antony, or Lear,
and which leaves us at the close rather exultant
than depressed. This tragedy is purely depressing
because it strikes less deep; the harms do not rend
and shatter, but secretly undermine and insidiously
frustrate. Cressida is a symbol of the love which
may kindle valour for a moment, but in the end
saps heroism and romance at once, and which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
strikes the magnificent champions of Homeric
story themselves with a futility more tragic than
death, the futility hinted savagely in the Horatian
<i>Troiani cunnus teterrima belli Causa</i>, and superbly
in Faustus’s great apologue to ‘the face that
launched the thousand ships.’</p>

<p>In <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, on the other hand, a
type of love not in its origin loftier or purer than
that of Troilus and Cressida is seen dominating
two souls of magnificent compass and daemonic
force. Antony is held by his serpent of old Nile
in the grip of a passion which insolently tramples
on moral and institutional bonds, private and
public alike; which brings the lovers to ruin and
to death; and which yet invests their fall with a
splendour beside which the triumph of their conqueror
appears cold and mean. There is no
conflict, no weighing of love and empire, as great
alternatives, against each other, in the manner of
Corneille; nor does Shakespeare take sides with
either; he neither reprobates Antony, like
Plutarch, for sacrificing duty to love, nor glorifies
him, like the author of the Restoration drama,
<i>All for Love, or the World Well Lost</i>; still less does
he seek to strike a balance between these views.
He is no ethical theorist trying exactly to measure
right or wrong, but a great poet whose comprehensive
soul had room, together, for many kinds
of excellence incompatible in the experience of
ordinary men. That Antony’s passion for Cleopatra
not only ruins his colossal power in the state but
saps his mental and moral strength is made as
mercilessly clear in Shakespeare as in Plutarch.
He is ‘the noble ruin of her magic.’ But it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
equally clear that this passion enlarges and enriches
his emotional life; in a sense other than that
intended by the sober Enobarbus,</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">A diminution in our captain’s brain</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">and enlarged feeling opens up new regions of imagination
and lifts him to unapproached heights of
poetry, as in the unarming-scene with Eros (IV, xiv.)
and the farewell speeches to Cleopatra (‘I am
dying, Egypt, dying,’ IV, xv.). And Cleopatra
too, in the ‘infinite variety’ of her moods, has
momentary flickerings of genuine devotion of which
she was before incapable. Momentary only, it is
true; the egoist, the actress, the coquette, are
only fitfully overcome; in her dying speech itself
the accent of them all is heard. The ‘baser
elements’ are not expelled, but the nobler ‘fire
and air’ to which she dreams that she is resolved,
gleam for a fitful instant in her cry ‘Husband, I
come,’ to yield a moment later to jealous alarm
lest Lear should have Antony’s kiss, and vindictive
satisfaction at having outwitted Cæsar.</p>

<p class="p2">Shakespeare’s poetry takes account of so vast a
number of other things, of so many other ways
of living and aspects of life, that we hardly think
even of the author of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> as in any
special sense the poet of Love. Nor is he, if we
mean by this that he thinks or speaks of Love
in the transcendent way of Dante, or Lucretius,
or Spenser, or Shelley. Love with them is part
of the vital frame of the universe. Lucretius (in
spite of his atomist creed) saw it pervading ‘all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
that moves below the gliding stars, the sea and
its ships, the earth and its flocks and flowers.’
Dante saw it as the force which not only draws
men and women together, but ‘moves the Sun
and the other stars.’ Spenser saw it as ‘the
Lord of all the world by right, that rules all
creatures by his powerful saw.’ Shelley saw it
as the sustaining force blindly woven through the
web of Being. For such heights of poetic metaphysic
we do not look in Shakespeare. He is one
of the greatest of poets, and his poetry has less
almost than any other the semblance of myth
and dream; its staple is the humanity we know,
its basis the ground we tread; what we call the
prose world, far from being excluded, is genially
taken in. And precisely where he is greatest, in
the sublime ruin of the tragedies, love between
the sexes has on the whole a subordinate place,
and is there most often fraught, as we have seen,
with disaster and frustration. So it seemed to
Keats when he turned from ‘golden-tongued
Romance’ to ‘burn through’ the strife of ‘damnation
with impassioned clay’ in <i>King Lear</i>.
Shakespeare certainly did not, so far as we can
judge, regard sexual love (like some moderns) as
either the clue to human life or as in any way
related to the structure of the universe. But if,
instead of these abstract questions, we ask whether
any poet has united in a like degree veracious
appreciation of love in its existing conditions with
apprehension of all its ideal possibilities, we shall
not dispute Shakespeare’s place among the foremost
of the poets of love.</p>

<p><b>THE POETRY

OF LUCRETIUS</b></p>
</div>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Lucretius stands alone in the controversial force and energy
with which the genius of negation inspires him, and transforms
into sublime reasons for firm act, so long as living breath is ours,
the thought that the life of a man is no more than the dream of
a shadow.’—<span class="smcap">Lord Morley’s</span> <i>Recollections</i>.</p>
</div>

<h3>I</h3>

<p class="drop-capi">THERE was a time when the title of this essay
would have been received as a paradox, if
not as a contradiction in terms. Lessing, as is
well known, declared roundly that Lucretius was
‘a versifier, not a poet,’ and Lessing is one of
the greatest of European critics. It is easy, indeed,
to explain in part his trenchant condemnation.
It reflects his implicit acceptance of Aristotle’s
<i>Poetics</i>—which he said was for him as absolutely
valid as Euclid, and therefore of Aristotle’s doctrine
that poetry is imitation of human action.
Lessing’s insistence on this doctrine was extraordinarily
salutary in his day, and definitely
lowered the status of the dubious kinds known as
descriptive, allegorical, satirical, and didactic poetry,
in a century too much given to them all. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
phrase of his about the imitation of human action
marked out a correct, well-defined, and safe channel
for the stream of poetry to pursue, and some of the
slender poetic rills of his generation improved their
chance of survival by falling into it and flowing
between its banks. But Lessing did not reckon
with the power of poetic genius to force its own
way to the sea through no matter how tangled and
tortuous a river-bed,—nay, to capture from the very
obstructions it overcomes new splendours of foam
and rainbow unknown perhaps to the well-regulated
stream. In plain language, he did not reckon
with the fact that a <i>prima facie</i> inferior form, such
as satire or didactic, may not only have its inferiority
outweighed by compensating beauties, but
may actually elicit and provoke beauties not otherwise
to be had, and thus become not an obstacle,
but an instrument of poetry. Nor did he foresee
that such a recovery of poetic genius, such an
effacement of the old boundaries, such a withdrawal
of the old taboos, was to come with the
following century, nay, was actually impending
when he wrote. Goethe, who read the <i>Laokoon</i>
entranced, as a young student at Leipzig, honoured
its teaching very much on this side of idolatry
when he came to maturity. As a devoted investigator
of Nature, who divined the inner continuity
of the flower and the leaf with the same penetrating
intuition which read the continuity of a man, or
of a historic city, in all the phases of their growth,
Goethe was not likely to confine poetry within the
bounds either of humanity or of the drums and
tramplings, the violence, passion, and sudden
death, for which human action in poetic criticism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
has too commonly stood. He himself wrote a
poem of noble beauty on the <i>Metamorphosis of
Plants</i> (1797)—a poem which suffices to show that
it is possible to be poetically right while merely
unfolding the inner truth of things in perfectly
adequate speech.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> We cannot wonder, then, that
Lucretius and the poem <i>On the Nature of Things</i>
excited in the greatest of German poets the liveliest
interest and admiration. On the score of subject
alone he eagerly welcomed the great example of
Lucretius. But he saw that Lucretius had supreme
gifts as a poet, which would have given distinction
to whatever he wrote, and which, far from being
balked by the subject of his choice, found in it
peculiarly large scope and play. ‘What sets out
Lucretius so high,’ he wrote (1821) to his friend
v. Knebel, author of the first German translation,
‘what sets him so high and assures him eternal
renown, is a lofty faculty of sensuous intuition,
which enables him to describe with power; in
addition, he disposes of a powerful imagination,
which enables him to pursue what he has seen
beyond the reach of sense into the invisible depths
of Nature and her most mysterious recesses.’<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
But while Goethe thus led the way in endorsing
without reserve the Lucretian conception of what
the field of poetry might legitimately include, he
contributed to the discussion nothing, so far as I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
know, so illuminating or so profound as the great
saying of Wordsworth: ‘poetry is the impassioned
expression which is in the countenance of all science.’
For Wordsworth here sweeps peremptorily away
the boundary marks set up, for better or worse,
by ancient criticism—he knows nothing of a poetry
purely of man or purely of action: he finds the
<i>differentia</i> of poetry not in any particular choice of
subject out of the field of real things, but in the
<i>impassioned</i> handling of them whencesoever drawn,
and therefore including the impassioned handling
of reality as such, or, in the Lucretian phrase, of
<i>the nature of things</i>.</p>

<p>What did he mean by <i>impassioned?</i> Something
more, certainly, than the enthusiasm of a writer
possessed with his theme, or even of one eager, as
Lucretius was, to effect by its means a glorious
purgation in the clotted soul of a friend. We
come nearer when we recall the profound emotion
stirred in Wordsworth by ‘earth’s tears and mirth,
her humblest mirth and tears,’ or the thought,
‘too deep for tears,’ given him by the lowliest
flower of the field. Such passion as this is not
easily analysed, but it implies something that we
may call participation on the one side and response
on the other. The poet finds himself in Nature,
finds there something that answers to spiritual
needs of his own. The measure of the poet’s mind
will be the measure of the value of the response he
receives. A small poet will people Nature with
fantastic shapes which reflect nothing but his
capricious fancy or his self-centred desires. That
is not finding a response in Nature, but putting
one into her mouth; a procedure like that of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
bustling conversationalist who, instead of listening
to your explanation, cuts it short with a ‘You
mean to say’—whatever it suits him to suppose.
But the poet of finer genius will neither seek nor
be satisfied with such hollow response as this. If
he finds himself in Nature, it will not be his shallow
fancies or passing regrets that he finds, but his
furthest reach, and loftiest appetency of soul.
He will not properly be said to ‘subdue things
to the mind,’ as Bacon declared it to be the
characteristic aim of poetry to do, instead of,
like philosophy, subduing the mind to things.
But he will feel after analogies to mind in the
universe of things which mind contemplates and
interprets.</p>

<p>Such an analogy, for instance, is the sense of
<i>continuity</i> underlying the changing show of the
material world, corresponding to the continuity of
our own self-consciousness through the perpetual
variations of our soul states. The doctrine of a
permanent substance persisting through the multiplicity
of Nature, and giving birth to all its passing
modes, belongs as much to poetry as to philosophy,
and owes as much to impassioned intuition as to
a priori thought. Under the name of the <i>One
and the Many</i> the problem of Change and Permanence
perplexed and fascinated every department
of Greek thought: it provoked the opposite
extravagances of Heracleitos, who declared change
to be the only form of existence, and of the Eleatics,
who denied that it existed at all; but it also inspired
the ordered and symmetrical beauty of the Parthenon
and the Pindaric ode. ‘When we feel the
poetic thrill,’ says Santayana, ‘it is when we find<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
fulness in the concise, and depth in the clear; and
that seems to express with felicitous precision the
genius of Hellenic art.’</p>

<p>A second such analogy is the discovery of <i>infinity</i>.
Common sense observes measure and rule, complies
with custom, and takes its ease when its day’s
work is done; but we recognize a higher quality
in the love that knows no measure, in the spiritual
hunger and thirst which are never stilled. Therefore,
at the height of our humanity, we find ourselves
in the universe in proportion as it sustains
and gives scope for an endlessly ranging and endlessly
penetrating thought. The Stoics looked on
the universe as a globe pervaded by what Munro
unkindly calls <i>a rotund and rotatory god</i>; at the
circumference of which all existence, including that
of space, simply stopped; common sense revolts,
but imagination is even more rudely balked, and
we glory in the defiant description of Epicurus
passing beyond the flaming walls of the world.
Yet we are stirred with a far more potent intellectual
sympathy when the idea is suggested, say
by Spinoza, that space and time themselves are
but particular modes of a universe which exists
also in an infinite number of other ways; or when,
in the final cantos of Dante’s <i>Paradiso</i>, after
passing up from Earth, the centre, through the
successive ever-widening spheres that circle round
it, till we reach the Empyrean, the whole perspective
and structure of the universe are suddenly
inverted, and we see the real centre, God, as a single
point of dazzling intensity, irradiating existence
‘through and through.’ Then we realize that
the space we have been laboriously traversing is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
only the illusive medium of our sense-existence,
and without meaning for the Eternity and Infinity
of divine reality.</p>

<p>This example has led us to the verge of another
class of poetic ideas, those in which poetry discovers
in the world not merely analogies of mind, but
mind itself. This is the commonest, and in some
of its phases the cheapest and poorest, intellectually,
of all poetic ideas. It touches at one pole
the naive personation which peoples earth and air
for primitive man with spirits whom he seeks by
ritual and magic to propitiate or to circumvent.
The brilliant and beautiful woof of myth is, if we
will, poetry as well as religion; the primitive and
rudimentary poetry of a primitive and rudimentary
religion. Yet it points, however crudely, to the
subtler kinds of response which a riper poetic
insight may discover. If the glorious anthropomorphism
of Olympus and Asgard has faded for
ever, the mystery of life, everywhere pulsing through
Nature, and perpetually reborn ‘in man and beast
and earth and air and sea,’ cries to the poet in
every moment of his experience with a voice which
will not be put by, and the symbols from soul-life
by which he seeks to convey his sense of it, if they
often read human personality too definitely into
the play of that elusive mystery, yet capture
something in it which escapes the reasoned formulas
of science, and justify the claim of poetic experience
to be the source of an outlook upon the world, of
a vision of life, with which, no less than with those
reached through philosophy and religion, civilization
has to reckon.</p>

<p>The poetic consciousness of soul has thus left a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
deep impress upon the medium of ideas through
which we currently regard both Nature and Man.
It has imbued with a richer significance and a
livelier appeal those analogies in Nature of which
I spoke; turning the sublime but bare conceptions
of continuity and substance into Wordsworth’s
<i>something more deeply interfused</i>, or Shelley’s <i>Love
... through the web of Being blindly wove;</i> turning
the abstraction of infinity into limitless aspiration,
or into that ‘infinite passion’ which Browning
felt across ‘the pain of finite hearts that yearn.’</p>

<p>On the other hand, in its interpretation of Man,
the poetic soul-consciousness, so extraordinarily
intense on the emotional and imaginative side,
has lifted these aspects of soul into prominence;
illuminating and sustaining everywhere the impassioned
insight which carries men outside and
beyond themselves, in heroism, in prophecy, in
creation, in love; which makes the past alive for
them, and the future urgent; which lifts them to
a vision of good and evil beyond that of moral
codes; to the perception that danger is the true
safety, and death, as Rupert Brooke said, ‘safest
of all’; which in a word gives wing and scope and
power to that in man which endures, as the stream
endures though its water is ever gliding on, and
makes us ‘feel that we are greater than we know.’</p>

<p>I have tried to sketch out some of the ways in
which a scientific poetry is possible without disparagement
to either element in the description.
Let me now proceed to apply some of these ideas
to the great poet of science who is our immediate
subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span></p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>In this assembly it is unnecessary to recall the
little that is told, on dubious authority, of the life
which began a little less than a hundred years
before the Christian era, and ended when he was
not much over forty, when Virgil was a very young
man. All that is told of his life is the story that
he went mad after receiving a love-philtre, composed
the books of his great poem, <i>On the Nature
of Things</i> in his lucid intervals, and finally died
by his own hand. It is this tradition which
Tennyson with great art has worked up into his
noble poem. We need not here discuss the truth
either of the tradition of madness or of that of
suicide. What is certain is that no poem in the
world bears a more powerful impress of coherent
and continuous thought. While the poets of his
own time and of the next generation, though deeply
interested in his poetry and in his ideas, know
nothing of the tragic story which first emerges in
a testimony four centuries later.</p>

<p>Lucretius called his poem by the bald title <i>On
the Nature of Things</i>. But no single term or
phrase can describe the aims which, distinct but
continually playing into and through one another,
compose the intense animating purpose of the book.
We may say that it is at once a scientific treatise,
a gospel of salvation, and an epic of nature and man;
yet we are rarely conscious of any one of these
aims to the exclusion of the rest. In none of these
three aims was Lucretius wholly original. In
each of them he had a great precursor among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
speculative thinkers and poets of Greece. His
science roughly speaking was the creation of
Democritus; his gospel of salvation was the
work of Epicurus; and the greatest example of a
poem on the nature of things, before his, had been
given by Empedocles, the poet-philosopher of
Agrigentum whom Matthew Arnold made the
mouthpiece of his grave and lofty hymn of nineteenth-century
pessimism. In his own country
his only predecessor in any sense was Ennius, the
old national poet who had first cast the hexameter
in the stubborn mould of Latin speech, to whom
he pays characteristically generous homage.</p>

<p>The atomic system of Democritus, which explained
all things in the universe as combinations
of different kinds of material particles, was a magnificent
contribution to physical science, and the
fertility of its essential idea is still unexhausted.
It touched the problems of mind and life, of ethics
and art, only indirectly, in so far as it resolved
mind and all its activities into functions of matter
and motion. Epicurus, on the other hand, a
saintly recluse, bent only upon showing the way
to a life of serene and cheerful virtue, took over
the doctrine of the great physicist of Abdêra,
without any touch of dispassionate speculative
interest, as that which promised most effectual
relief from disturbing interests and cares, and
especially from the disturbance generated by fear
of the gods and of a life after death. He might
have gone to the great Athenian idealists of the
fourth century, the immortal masters not only of
those who know, but of those who think and
create, whether in science or in poetry or in citizenship.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
But his aim was precisely to liberate from
these distracting energies, and allure a weary
generation from the forum and the workshop, even
the studio of letters or of art, and the temples of
the gods, into the choice seclusion of his garden—the
garden of a soul at peace, fragrant with innocent
and beautiful things. What Epicurus added of
his own to Democritus’ theory was an accommodation
not to truth but to convenience; and
the measure of his scientific ardour is given by his
easy toleration of conflicting explanations of the
same phenomenon, provided they dispense with
the intervention of the gods. While the measure
of his attachment to poetry is given by his counsel
to his disciples to go past it with stopped ears, as
by the siren’s deadly song.</p>

<p>It was this scientific doctrine, adopted by Epicurus
in the interest not of science but of his gospel of
deliverance from the cares of superstition, that
Lucretius took over with the fervour of discipleship.
He was not, like Pope in the <i>Essay <span class="err" title="original: of">on</span> Man</i>,
providing an elegant dress for philosophic ideas
which he only half understood and abandoned in
alarm when they threatened to be dangerous.
He was the prophet of Epicureanism, and it is
among the prophets of the faiths by which men live
and die that we must seek a parallel to the passionate
earnestness with which he proclaims to Memmius
the saving gospel of Epicurus—to that same
Memmius who a few years later showed his piety
to Epicurus’ memory by destroying his house.
It was the hope of pouring the light and joy of
saving truth upon the mind of this rather obtuse
Roman, his beloved friend, that Lucretius laboured,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
he tells us, through the silent watches of the night,
seeking phrase and measure which might make
deep and hidden things clear.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But Lucretius
felt and thought also as a poet and in the temper
of poetry. He was not ‘lending his pen’ to a good
cause, nor turning Greek science into Latin hexameters
in order that they might be more vividly
grasped or more readily remembered. He was
conquering a new way in poetry; striking out a
virgin path which no foot before his had trod.
For Empedocles had had far narrower aims. And
he calls on the Muses for aid with as devout a
faith in his poetic mission in the great adventure
as Milton had when he summoned Urania or some
greater Muse to be his guide while he attempted
‘things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.’
What we admire unreservedly in him, declares a
great French poet who died only the other day,
Sully-Prudhomme, is the breath of independence
which sweeps through the entire work of this most
robust and precise of poets.</p>

<p>We see the temper of the poet at the outset,
in the wonderful transfiguration which the gentle
recluse Epicurus undergoes in the ardent brain of
his Roman disciple. For it was of this enemy of
disturbing emotion, this quietist of paganism, this
timid and debonnaire humanitarian, that Lucretius
drew the magnificent and astonishing portrait
which immediately follows the prologue of the
<i>De Rerum Natura</i>. The Lucretian Epicurus is a
Prometheus—the heroic Greek who first of mortals
dared to defy and withstand the monstrous tyrant
Religion to her face. No fabled terror could appal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
him, no crashing thunder, nor the anger of heaven;
these only kindled the more the eager courage of
his soul, to be the first to break the bars of Nature’s
gates. So the living might of his soul prevailed;
and he passed beyond the flaming walls of the
world and traversed in mind and spirit the immeasurable universe;
returning thence in triumph to tell
us what can, and what cannot, come into being;
having trampled under foot Religion who once
crushed mankind, and lifted mankind in turn by
his victory up to the height of heaven.</p>

<p>One might well surmise that a philosophy which
a poet could thus ardently proclaim was itself,
after all, not without the seeds and springs of
poetry; and that Lucretius in choosing to expound
it in verse was not staking everything on his power
of making good radical defects of substance by
effective surface decoration or brilliant digressions.
He recognized, no doubt, a difference in popular
appeal between his substance and his form, and
in a famous and delightful passage compares himself
to the physician who touches the edge of the
bitter cup with honey, ensnaring credulous childhood
to its own good. So, he tells Memmius, he
is spreading the honey of the Muses over his difficult matter,
that he may hold him by the charm of
verse until the nature of things have grown clear
to his sight. But Lucretius is here putting himself
at the point of view of the indifferent layman,
and especially of the rather obtuse layman whose
interest he was with almost pathetic eagerness
seeking to capture. One guesses that Memmius,
like the boy, was by no means reconciled to the
wormwood because it was prefaced with honey;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
and modern critics who, like Mommsen, condemn
his choice of subject as a blunder, come near to
adopting the resentful boy’s point of view. But
in the splendid lines which immediately precede,
though they form part of the same apology to
Memmius, the poet involuntarily betrays his own
very different conception of the matter. The
hope of glory, he says, has kindled in his breast
the love of the Muses, ‘whereby inspired I am
exploring a virgin soil of poetry hitherto untrodden
by any foot. O the joy of approaching the unsullied springs,
and quaffing them, O the joy of
culling flowers unknown, whence may be woven
a splendid wreath for my head, such as the Muses
have arrayed no man’s brows withal before; first
because I am reporting on a great theme, and
undoing the tight knot of superstition from the
minds of men; and then because I convey dark
matters in such transparent verse, touching everything
with the Muses’ charm.’<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Here, in spite of the last words, Lucretius clearly
feels that his matter is something more than the
wormwood which he overlays with honey; it is a
vast region of implicit poetry which he, first of
poets, is going to discover and annex; and he
rests his claim to the poetic wreath he expects
to win, in the first place upon this greatness of
the subject matter itself, and secondly, not as the
wormwood and honey theory would suggest, on
the ingenious fancy which decorates or disguises
it, but on the lucid style which allows it to shine
in, as through a window, upon the ignorant mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>Let us then consider from this point of view the
subject of Lucretius. This subject, as he conceives
it, has two aspects. On the one side it is negative;—an
annihilating criticism of all the crude religion
founded upon fear—fear of the gods, fear of death
and of something after death; criticism delivered
with remorseless power and culminating in the
sinewy intensity of the terrible line</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Tantum religio potuit suadere malorum,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">which transfixes once for all the consecrated principle
of <i>tabu</i> everywhere dominant in the primitive
faiths, the product of man’s cowardice, as magic
is the product of his pride.</p>

<p>The other aspect is constructive; the building
up of the intellectual and moral framework of a
worthy human life, by setting forth the true nature
of the universe, the history of life, and the development
of man; in other words, the story of his
struggle through the ages, with the obstacles
opposed to him by the power of untamed nature,
by wild beasts, storms, inundations, by the rivalry
and antagonism of other men, and by the wild
unreason in his own breast. Lucretius saw as
clearly as any modern thinker that man’s conduct
of his life, whether in the narrow circle of domestic
happiness and personal duty, or in the larger
sphere of civic polity, must be based upon a comprehension
of the external world and of the past
through which we have grown to what we are;
and making allowance for his more limited resources<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
and his more confined point of view, he carried it
out with magnificent power. So that if his poem
remains in nominal intention a didactic treatise,
in its inner substance and purport it might better
be described as a colossal epic of the universe,
with man for its protagonist and the spectres of
the gods for its vanquished foes; and wanting
neither the heroic exultations nor the tragic dooms,
neither the melancholy over what passes nor the
triumph in what endures, which go to the making
of the greatest poetry.</p>

<p>These two aspects—criticism and construction—are
thus most intimately bound together in the
poem, but can yet be considered apart. And to
each belongs its own peculiar and distinct vein of
poetry. On the whole it is the former, at first
sight so much less favourable to poetic purposes,
which has most enthralled posterity. For the
voice of Lucretius is here a distinctive, almost a
solitary voice. The poets for the most part have
been the weavers of the veil of dreams and visions
in whose glamour the races of mankind have
walked: but here came a poet, and one of the
greatest, who rent the veil asunder and bade men
gaze upon the nature of things naked and unadorned.
And his austere chaunt of triumph as he pierces
illusion and scatters superstition, has in it something
more poignant and thrilling than many a
song of voluptuous ecstacy or enchanted reverie.
For, after all, the passing of an old order of things
and the coming of a new has always at least the
interest of colossal drama, and cannot leave us
unmoved, however baneful we may hold the old
order to have been, however we may exult in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
the deliverance effected by the new. So Milton’s
celebration of the birth of Christ only reaches the
heights of poetry when he is telling of the passing
of the old pagan divinities:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent6">The lonely mountains o’er</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">And the resounding shore,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A voice of weeping heard and loud lament;</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">From haunted spring and dale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Edged with poplar pale,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The parting genius is with sighing sent;</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">With flower-inwoven tresses torn</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thicket mourn.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">Through the Christian’s exultation there sounds,
less consciously perhaps, but more clear, the
Humanist scholar’s sense of tragedy and pathos.
In this sense Milton’s Ode has affinity with poems
like Schiller’s <i>Gods of Greece</i>, where grief for the
passing of the pagan faith is untouched by
Christian sentiment; but precisely its more complex
and subtle emotion raises Milton’s poem higher.
In <i>Hyperion</i>, even more, we are made to feel the
pathos of the passing of the fallen divinity of Saturn
and his host; and Hyperion himself, the sun-god
of the old order of physical light, is more magnificently
presented than Apollo, the sun-god of the new
order of radiant intelligence and song. Lucretius,
as we shall see, brings back the old divinity in a
sublime way of his own; but he feels the beneficence
of the new order of scientific vision and
inviolable law too profoundly to have any sense
of pathos at the passing of the reign of superstition
and caprice. He is rather possessed with flaming
wrath as he recalls the towering evils of which that
old regime had been guilty: the wrath of a prophet,
more truly divine in spirit than the divinities he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
assailed, as Prometheus is more divine than Zeus.
Again and again we are reminded, as we read his
great invectives, not of the sceptics mocking all
gods indiscriminately in the name of enlightened
good sense, but of a Hebrew prophet, chastising
those who sacrifice to the gods of the Gentiles, in
the name of the God of righteousness who refuses
to be worshipped with offerings of blood. There
is surely a spirit not far remote from this in the
indignant pity with which he tells, in a famous
and splendid passage, the sacrifice of Iphigenia
at the divine bidding, as the price of the liberation
of the Grecian fleet on its way to Troy:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>How often has fear of the gods begotten impious and criminal
acts! What else was it that led the chieftains of Greece, foremost
of men, foully to stain the altar of Artemis with the blood of the
maiden Iphigenia? Soon as the victim’s band was bound about
her virgin locks, and she saw her father grief-stricken before the altar,
and at his side the priests concealing the knife, and the onlookers
shedding tears at the sight, dumb with fear she sank on her knees
to the ground. And it availed her nothing at that hour that she
had been the first to call the king by the name of father; for she
was caught up by the hands of men, and borne trembling to the
altar; not to have a glad wedding hymn sung before her when these
sacred rites were over, but to be piteously struck down, a victim,
stained with her own stainless blood, by the hand of a father in the
very flower of her bridal years; and all in order to procure that a
happy deliverance might be granted to the captive fleet. So huge
a mass of evils has fear of the gods brought forth! (I. 84-101.)<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Thus the crucial proof of the badness of the old
religions is derived from the hideous violence
done in their name to the natural and beautiful
pieties of the family.</p>

<p>Yet, with all his fierce aversion for this baneful
fear, Lucretius feels profoundly how natural it is.
His intense imagination enters into the inmost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
recesses of the human heart, and runs counter,
as it were, to the argument of his powerful reason;
riveting upon our senses with almost intolerable
force the beliefs which he is himself seeking to
dispel; so that though there is no trace of doubt
or obscurity in his own mind, his words need only
to be set in a different context to become a plea
for that which he is using them to refute. Thus
his very derision of the Stoic doctrine of an all-pervading
God is conveyed in language of what one
is again prompted to call Hebraic magnificence.
‘What power can rule the immeasurable All, or
hold the reins of the great deep? who can revolve
the heavens and warm the earth with ethereal
fires? who can be everywhere present, making
dark the sky and thrilling it with clashing sound...?’
(V. 1234 f.) Do we not seem to listen to
an echo of the ironical questions of the Jahveh
of the Book of Job?</p>

<p>There he feels only scorn for the believer, in spite
of his involuntary imaginative hold upon the belief.
But in another passage we see the poet himself
shudder with the fear that his logic is in the act
of plucking up by the roots:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>When we gaze upward at the great vault of heaven, and the
empyrean fixed above the shining stars, and consider the paths of
sun and moon, then the dread will start into life within us lest haply
we should find it to be the immeasurable might of the gods which
moves the blazing stars along their diverse ways. For dearth of
argument tempts us to wonder whether the world was ever begotten,
and whether it be destined to perish when its ceaseless movements
have worn it out, or endowed with immortal life glide on perpetually,
defying all the might of time. And then what man is there whose
heart does not shrink with terror of the gods, whose limbs do not
creep with fear, when the parched earth trembles at the lightning
stroke, and the roar of thunder rolls through the sky! Do not the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
peoples shudder, and haughty kings quake with fear, lest for some
foul deed or arrogant speech a dire penalty has been incurred and
the hour be come when it must be paid? For when the might of
the hurricane sweeps the commander of a fleet before it along the
seas, with all his force of legions and elephants, does he not approach
the gods with prayers for their favour and helping winds; and all
in vain, for often enough none the less he is caught in the whirlpool
and flung into the jaws of death? So utterly is some hidden
power seen to consume the works of man, and to trample and deride
all the symbols of his glory and his wrath (V. 1204 f.).</p>
</div>

<p>But beyond the fear of what the gods may do to
us on earth, lay another more insidious and ineluctable
fear—the dread of what may befall us after
death. It was a main part of Lucretius’s purpose
to meet this by showing that death meant dissolution,
and dissolution unconsciousness; but men
continued to dread, and this is the reasoning,
equally inconclusive and brilliant, with which he
confronts them:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Therefore since death annihilates, and bars out from being
altogether him whom evils might befall, it is plain that in death
there is nothing for us to fear, and that a man cannot be unhappy
who does not exist at all, and that it matters not a jot whether
a man has been born, when death the deathless has swallowed up
life that dies.</p>

<p>Therefore, when you see a man bewail himself that after death
his body will rot, or perish in flames or in the jaws of beasts, his
profession clearly does not ring true, and there lurks a secret sting
in his heart, for all his denial that he believes there is any feeling
in the dead. For, I take it, he does not fulfil his promise, nor
follow out his principle, and sever himself out and out from life,
but unconsciously makes something of himself survive. For when
as a living man he imagines his future fate, and sees himself
devoured by birds and beasts, he pities himself; for he does not
distinguish between himself and the other, nor sever himself from
the imagined body, but imagines himself to be it, and impregnates
it with his own feeling. Hence he is indignant that he has been
created mortal, nor sees that there will not in reality be after death
another self, to grieve as a living being that he is dead, and feel
pangs as he stands by, that he himself is lying there being mangled
or consumed.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span></p>

<p>Then he supposes the dying man’s friends to
condole with him:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Now no more thy glad home shall welcome thee, nor a beloved
wife, nor sweet children run to snatch kisses, touching thy heart
with secret delight. No more wilt thou be prosperous in thy
doings, no more be a shelter to thy dear ones. A single, cruel day
has taken from thee, hapless man, all the need of life. So they
tell you, but they forget to add that neither for any one of these
things wilt thou any longer feel desire (III. 863).</p>
</div>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>So much then for the first aspect of Lucretius’s
poem—the criticism of the old religions. Most of
the recognized and famous ‘poetry’ of the book is
connected, like the passages I have quoted, with
this negative side of his creed. But I am more
concerned to show that a different and not less
noble vein of poetry was rooted in the rich positive
appetencies of his nature; in his acute and exquisite
senses; in the vast and sublime ideas which underlay
his doctrine of the world; in his intense apprehension
of the zest of life; and, on the other hand,
penetrating, like an invisible but potent spirit,
the texture of his reasoned unconcern, his profound,
unconfessed sense of the pathos of death, his
melancholy in the presence of the doom of universal
dissolution which he foresaw for the world and for
mankind.</p>

<p>Let us look first at the main constructive idea;
the atomic theory of Leucippus and Democritus,
taken over by Epicurus and expounded by Lucretius.</p>

<p>For this theory was in effect, and probably in
intention, a device for overcoming that antithesis of
the One and the Many, of Permanence and Change,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
of which I have spoken. The Eleatics had declared
that pure Being was alone real, and denied Change
and Motion; Heracleitus declared that nothing
was real but Change, and the only perpetuity
‘flux.’ The founder of atomism, Leucippus,
showed that it was possible to hold, in the phrase
of Browning’s philosophic Don Juan, that there is
in ‘all things change, and permanence as well,’
by supposing that shifting and unstable world of
the senses, where all things die and are born, to
be composed of uncreated and indestructible
elements. Underlying the ceaseless fluctuations
of Nature, and life as we see them, lay a continuity
of eternal substance, of which they were the passing
modes;—one of the greatest of philosophical conceptions,
Mr. Santayana has called it, but one
also appealing profoundly to the specifically poetic
intuition which I have described. Whether the
permanent apprehended through the flux of sense
be a spiritual substance like Plato’s ideas, or
Shelley’s ‘white radiance of eternity,’ or whether
it be the constant form and function of the flowing
river, as in Wordsworth’s Duddon sonnet; or
whether, as here, it be a background of material
particles perpetually combining and resolved, we
have the kind of intuition which gives the thrill of
poetry; we discover ‘sweep in the concise, and
depth in the clear,’ infinite perspectives open out
in the moment and in the point, and however
remote the temper of Spinozan mysticism may be,
we yet in some sort see things ‘in the light of
eternity.’</p>

<p>In Lucretius this conception found a mind capable
of being ravished by its imaginative grandeur,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
as well as of pursuing it indefatigably through the
thorniest mazes of mechanical proof. The contagious
fervour which breathes through his poem
is no mere ardour of the disciple bent on winning
converts, or the joy of the literary craftsman as
his hexameters leap forth glowing on the anvil; it
is the sacred passion of one who has had a sublime
vision of life and nature, and who bears about the
radiance of it into all the work to which he has
set his hand. It is not because of anything that
Lucretius adds to Epicurus—in theory he really
adds nothing at all—that the impression produced
by his poem differs so greatly from that of all we
know—in fragments and at second hand, it is true—of
Epicurus’s own writings. The ultimate principles
are the same, but the accent is laid at a different
point. The parochial timidities of Epicurus have
left their traces on the Roman’s page, but they
appear as hardly more than rudimentary survivals
among the native inspirations of a man of heroic
mettle and valour, Roman tenacity, and native
sweep of mind. He cannot quite break free from
some speculative foibles which show the Master’s
shallow opportunism at its worst—such as the
dictum that the sun is about as large as it looks,
a lamp hung a little above the earth, and daily
lighted and put out; but he becomes himself when
he lets his imagination soar into the infinities of
time and space which his faith opens out or leaves
room for. It is a triumph of poetry as well as of
common sense when he scoffs at the Stoic dogma
of a Space which abruptly comes to an end; when
he stations an archer at the barrier and ironically
bids him shoot his arrow into the nothingness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
beyond. Or in more sombre mood, how grave
an intensity he puts into a common thought, like
that of the end of life, by the sublimely terrible
epithet <i>immortal</i> which he applies to death:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Mortalem vitam Mors cum inmortalis ademit (III. 869).</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">or into a mere reminder that birth and death
are always with us, by making us feel the endless
concomitant succession through the ages of funeral
wailings, and the cry of the new-born child (II. 578).
He accepts without question the swerving of
the atoms, devised by Epicurus—child and man
of genius at once—to refute the Stoic dogma of
necessity; but what possesses his mind and imagination
is not these intrusions of caprice, but the
great continuities and uniformities of existence,
which follow from the perpetual dissolution and
remaking of life. ‘Rains die, when father ether
has tumbled them into the lap of mother earth;
but then goodly crops spring up and trees laden
with fruit; and by them we and the beasts are
fed, and joyous cities teem with children and the
woods ring with the song of young birds’ (I. 250 f.).</p>

<p>Only, as such passages show, Lucretius grasps
these uniformities and continuities not as theoretic
abstractions, but as underlying conditions of the
teeming multiplicity and joyous profusion of living
Nature. His senses, imagination, and philosophic
intellect, all phenomenally acute and alert, wrought
intimately together; and he enters into and exposes
the life of the individual thing with an intensity
of insight and a realistic precision and power
which quicken us with its warm pulse, and burn
its image upon our brain, without ever relaxing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
our consciousness that it is part of an endless
process, and the incidental expression of an unalterable
law. For him, indeed, as for Dante, individuality
is an intrinsic part of law, and law of individuality.
Every being has its place and function, its
‘deep fixed boundaries’ (<i>terminus alte haerens</i>).
The very stone, for Dante, cleaves to the spot
where it lies. And the Roman as well as the
philosopher in Lucretius scornfully contrasts with
this Nature of minute and ubiquitous law the
fluid and chaotic world of myth, where anything
might become anything (cf. V. 126 f.).</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>None the less, his conception of the nature of
the process itself does insensibly undergo a change.
In the mind of an exponent so richly endowed and
so transparently sincere, the hidden flaw in his
system could not but at some point disturb its
imposing coherence. Atomism could not at bottom
explain life, and life poured with too abounding
a tide through the heart and brain of Lucretius
not to sap in some degree the authority of his
mechanical calculus, and to lend a surreptitious
persuasiveness to inconsistent analogies derived
from the animated soul. Without ostensibly disturbing
the integrity of his Epicurean creed, such
analogies have, in two ways, infused an alien colour
into his poetry and alien implications into his
thought. In the first place, he feels, as such
abounding natures will, that life—‘the mere living’—is
somehow very good, in spite of all the evils
it brings in its train, and death pathetic in spite of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
all the evils from which it sets us free. When he
is demonstrating that the world cannot have been
made by gods, he set forth its grave inherent
flaws of structure and arrangement with merciless
trenchancy—<i>tantâ stat praedita culpâ</i> (V. 199); and
like Lear, he makes the new-born child wail because
he is come into a world where so many griefs await
him. And no one ever urged with more passionate
eloquence that it is unreasonable to fear to die.
None the less, phrases charged with a different
feeling about life continually escape him. He
speaks of the <i>praeclara mundi natura</i> (V. 157). To
begin to live is to ‘rise up into the divine borders
of light’ (I. 20). And secondly, despite his philosophical
assurance, incessantly repeated, that birth
and death are merely different aspects of the same
continuous mechanical process, and that nothing
receives life except by the death of something else,
‘Alid ex alio reficit natura, nec ullam Rem gigni
patitur, nisi morte adiuta aliena’ (I. 264, etc.),
he cannot suppress suggestions that the creative
energy of the world is akin to that which with
conscious desire and will brings forth the successive
generations of Man. And so, in the astonishing
and magnificent opening address, the poet who was
about to demonstrate that the gods lived eternally
remote from the life of men, calls upon Venus, the
legendary mother of his own race, as the divine
power ever at work in this teeming universe, the
giver of increase, bringing all things to birth, from
the simplest corn blade to the might and glory of
the Roman Empire:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Mother of the Roman race, delight of gods and men, benign
Venus, who under the gliding constellations of heaven fillest with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
thy presence the sea with its ships and the earth with its fruits,
seeing that by thy power all the races of living things are conceived
and come to being in the light of day; before thee, O goddess, the
winds take flight, and the clouds of heaven at thy coming; at thy
feet the brown earth sheds her flowers of a thousand hues, before
thee the sea breaks into rippling laughter, and the sky rejoicing
glows with radiant light (I. 1 f.).</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">So grave and impassioned an appeal cannot be
treated as mere rhetorical ornament. If we call
it figure, it is figure of the kind which is not a
‘poetical’ substitute for prose, but conveys something
for which no other terms are adequate.
Lucretius, the exponent of Epicurus, doubtless
intended no heresy against the Epicurean theology;
but Lucretius, the poet, was carried by his vehement
imagination to an apprehension of the
creative energies of the world so intense and
acute that the great symbol of Venus rendered
it with more veracity than all that calculus
of atomic movements which he was about to
expound, and by which his logical intellect with
perfect sincerity believed it to be adequately
explained.</p>

<p>Far less astonishing than his bold rehabilitation
of the goddess of Love is his fetishistic feeling for
the Earth, the legendary mother of men. For him
too, as for primeval myth, she is the ‘universal
mother,’ who in her fresh youth brought forth
flower and tree, and bird and beast; from whose
body sprang finally the race of man itself; nay, he
tells us how the infants crept forth, ‘from wombs
rooted in the soil,’ and how, wherever this happened,
earth yielded naturally through her pores a liquor
most like to milk, ‘even as nowadays every woman
when she has given birth is filled with sweet milk,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
because all that current of nutriment streams
towards the breast’ (V. 788 f.).</p>

<p>It is true that elsewhere Lucretius speaks with
rationalistic condescension of the usage which calls
the Earth a mother and divine, as a phrase like
Bacchus for wine or Ceres for corn, permissible so
long as no superstitious fear is annexed to it
(II. 652 f.). But it is plain that the Earth’s motherhood
had a grip upon his poet’s imagination quite
other than could be exerted by any such tag of
poetic diction. Doubtless the fervour with which
he insists on it—‘Therefore again and again Earth
is rightly called Mother, seeing that she brought
forth the race of men and every beast and bird
in its due season’—is not wholly due to poetic
motives. He is eager to refute the Stoic doctrine
that men were sprung from heaven. But the poet
in him is, all the same, entranced by the sublimity
of the conception he is urging, and he describes
it with an afflatus which dwarfs that Stoic doctrine,
and makes the splendid legend of Cybele the Earth
Mother, elaborated by the Greek poets, seem puerile
with all its beauty. ‘In the beginning Earth hath
in herself the elements whence watersprings pouring
forth their coolness perpetually renew the boundless
Sea, and whence fires arise, making the ground in
many places hot, and belching forth the surpassing
flames of Ætna. Then she bears shining corn
and glad woodlands for the support of men, and
rivers and leaves and shining pastures for the
beasts that haunt the hills. Wherefore she is
called the mother of the gods and mother of beasts
and men’ (II. 589 f.).</p>

<p>This all-creating Earth is far enough no doubt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
from the benign Nature of Wordsworth, who
moulds her children by silent sympathy. But it
is not so remote from the Earth of Meredith, the
Mother who brings Man ‘her great venture’
forth, bears him on her breast and nourishes him
there, but ‘more than that embrace, that nourishment,
she cannot give.’</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">He may despair, and she has never heed.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She drinking his warm sweat will soothe his need,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Not his desire.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">Meredith too sees man, in dread of her, clutching
at invisible powers, as Lucretius’s sea-captain in
the storm makes vows to the gods. And Meredith’s
thought that man rises by ‘spelling at’ her laws
is no less Lucretian. But Meredith’s story of
Earth is full of hope, like his story of man. It is
perpetual advance. With Lucretius it is otherwise.</p>

<p>For the Earth is not only our Mother; she is our
tomb (II. 1148 f.). And the eternal energy of
creation is not only matched by the eternal energy
of dissolution, but here and now is actually yielding
ground to it. The Earth, so prolific in her joyous
youth, is now like a woman who has ceased to bear,
‘worn out by length of days’ (V. 820 f.). In the
whole universe birth and death absolutely balance,
the equation of mechanical values is never infringed;
the universe has no history, only a continuous
substitution of terms. But each living thing has
a history, it knows the exultation of onset and the
melancholy of decline; and its fear of death is not
cancelled by the knowledge that in that very
moment, and in consequence of that very fact,
some other living thing will be born. And thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
Lucretius, feeling for our Earth as a being very
near to us, and with which the issues of our existence
are involved, applies the doctrine to her
without shrinking indeed, but not without a human
shudder. The Earth had a beginning, and ineluctable
reason forces us to conclude that she will have
an end, and this not by a gradual evanescence or dispersion,
but by a sudden, terrific catastrophe, as in
a great earthquake, or world conflagration (V. 95 f.).</p>

<p>And he feels this abrupt extinction of the Earth
and its inhabitants to be tragic, notwithstanding
that extinction is, by his doctrine, only the condition
of creation, and that at the very moment of her
ruin, some other earth will be celebrating its
glorious birth. Earth has for him a life-history,
a biography, and he forgets that she is strictly
but a point at which the eternal drift of atoms
thickened for a time to a cluster, to be dispersed
again. Thus we see how this mechanical system,
ardently embraced by a poet, working freely upon
him, and itself coloured and transformed by his
mind, stirred in him two seemingly opposed kinds
of poetic emotion at once: the sublime sense of
eternal existence, and the tragic pathos of sudden
doom and inexorable passing away.</p>

<p>Hence the <i>melancholy</i> that in Lucretius goes along
with an enormous sense of life. To say that he puts
the ‘Nevermore’ of romantic sentimentality in
the place of that dispassionate ‘give and take’
of mechanics would do wrong to the immense
virility which animates every line of this athlete
among poets. Of the cheap melancholy of discontent
he knows as little as of the cheap satisfaction
of complacency, or of that literary melancholy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
where the sigh of Horace, or Ronsard, or
Herrick, over the passing of roses and all other
beautiful things covers a sly diplomatic appeal to
the human rosebud to be gathered while still there
is time. No, the melancholy of Lucretius is like
that of Dürer’s ‘Melancholia,’ the sadness of
strong intellect and far-reaching vision as it contemplates
the setting of the sun of time and the
ebbing of the tides of mortality; or like Wordsworth’s
mournful music of dissolution, only to be
heard by an ear emancipated from vulgar joys
and fears; or like the melancholy of Keats—the
veiled goddess who hath her shrine in the very
temple of delight—the <i>amari aliquid</i>, in Lucretius’s
own yet more pregnant words, which lurks in the
very sweetness of the flower.</p>

<p>Thus our ‘scientific poet’ appears in an extraordinary
if not unique way to have united the
functions and temper and achievement of science
and poetry. He ‘knew the causes of things,’
and could set them forth with marvellous precision
and resource; and the knowledge filled him with
lofty joy as of one standing secure above the welter
of doubt and fear in which the mass of men pass
their lives. To have reached this serene pinnacle
of intellectual security seemed to his greatest
follower Virgil a happiness beyond the reach of
his own more tender and devout genius, and he
commemorated it in splendid verses which Matthew
Arnold in our own day applied to Goethe:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And he was happy, if to know</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Causes of things, and far below</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">His feet to see the lurid flow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of terror and insane distress</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And headlong fate, be happiness.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span></p>
<p>There is, it may be, something that repels us,
something slightly inhuman, in this kind of lonely
happiness, and Lucretius does little to counteract
that impression when he himself compares it, in
another famous passage, to the satisfaction of
one who watches the struggle of a storm-tost ship
from the safe vantage-ground of the shore. Yet
Lucretius is far from being the lonely egoist that
such a passage might suggest; his poem itself was
meant as a helping hand to lift mankind to his own
security: he knew what devoted friendship was,
and we have pleasant glimpses of him wandering
with companions among the mountains,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> or sharing
a rustic meal stretched at ease on the grass by a
running brook.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Lucretius like his master had no
social philosophy, and it is his greatest deficiency
as a thinker; but he was not poor in social feeling.
His heart went out to men, as a physician, not
coldly diagnosing their disease, but eager to cure
them.</p>

<p>And so his feeling for Nature, for the universe
of things, though rooted in his scientific apprehension,
is not bounded by it. He seizes upon the
sublime conceptions which his science brought to
his view—the permanent substance amid perennial
change, the infinity of space and time—and his
vivid mind turns these abstractions into the radiant
vision of a universe to which the heaven of heavens,
as the old poets had conceived it, ‘was but a veil.’
But he went further, and shadowed forth, if half-consciously
and in spite of himself, the yet greater
poetic thought, of a living power pervading the
whole, drawing the elements of being together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
by the might of an all-permeating Love. And
thus Lucretius, the culminating expression of the
scientific thinking of Democritus and of the gospel
of Epicurus, foreshadows Virgil, whom he so deeply
influenced, and prophesies faintly but perceptibly
of Dante and of Shelley; as his annihilating
exposure of the religions founded upon fear insensibly
prepared the way for the religions of hope
and love.</p>

<p><b>MOUNTAIN SCENERY

IN KEATS</b></p>

<p class="drop-capi">THE ‘love of mountains’ which plays so
large a part in the poetry of the age of
Wordsworth, and has so few close analogies in
that of any other country or any earlier time,
offers matter of still unexhausted interest to the
student of poetic psychology. This is not the
place to consider how it happened that any mass
of boldly crumpled strata, on a certain scale,
became in the course of the eighteenth century
charged with a kind of spiritual electricity which
set up powerful answering excitements in the
sensitive beholder. Gray already in 1739 expressed
the potential reach and compass of these
excitements in our psychical life when he called
the scenery of the Grande Chartreuse ‘pregnant
with religion and poetry’—a thought which
Wordsworth’s sublime verses on the Simplon,
sixty years later, only made explicit. Not all the
mountain-excitement of the time was of this
quality; and we can distinguish easily enough
between the ‘picturesque,’ ‘romantic’ mountain
sentiment of Scott, to whom the Trossachs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
and Ben Venue spoke most eloquently when they
sounded to the pad of a horseman’s gallop, and
the ‘natural religion’ of Wordsworth, to whom
the same pass wore the air of a ‘Confessional’
apt for autumnal meditation on the brevity of
life. In the younger poets of the age mountain
sentiment is less original and profound than in
Wordsworth, less breezily elemental than in Scott.
The mountain poetry of Wordsworth concurred,
as an explicit stimulus to mountain sentiment,
with the inarticulate spell of the mountains themselves,
transforming in some degree the native
feeling and experience of almost all mountain-lovers
of the next twenty years, even when they
were of the calibre of Coleridge, Byron, and Shelley.
Yet even where the Wordsworthian colour is most
perceptible, as in <i>The Hymn in the Vale of Chamouni</i>,
in <i>Alastor</i>, <i>Mont Blanc</i>, and in the Third Canto
of <i>Childe Harold</i>, the younger poet has seen his
mountains with his own eyes and through the
glamour of his own passions, impregnated them
with his own genius and temperament. Shelley’s
mountains are no longer the quiet brotherhood of
Grasmere, with a listening star atop, but peaks of
flamelike aspiration, or embodied protests against
men’s code of crime and fraud; Byron’s are
warriors calling joyously to one another over the
lit lake across the storm. For all these poets—even
for Scott when he <i>was</i> a poet—mountain scenery
was not so much new matter to be described as a
new instrument of expression, a speaking symbol
for their own spiritual appetencies and ideal
dreams. Of its importance for the poetry of any
one of them there cannot be a moment’s doubt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
There remains, however, another poet, the youngest,
the shortest-lived, but in some respects the most
gifted of the whole group. On a general view
Keats appears to be sharply distinguished, in
regard to the characteristic here in question, from
all the rest. Mountains and mountain sentiment
seem to have a quite negligible place in his poetry.
It may be worth while to consider how far this is
really the case.</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>If we look to the sources of his experience,
Keats was more nearly secluded from the stimulus
of mountain scenery than any of his compeers.
By the outward circumstances, of his birth and
breeding he was in reality the ‘cockney poet’
of later derisive criticism. During the whole
formative period of youth he hardly encountered
even ‘wild’ scenery; what lay about him in
his infancy was at best the semi-suburban meadow
and woodland landscape of Edmonton, or the ‘little
hill’ (of Hampstead) on which he ‘stood tiptoe’
to command a wider view. Before the summer of
1818 there is no sign that either ‘mountain power’
or ‘mountain mystery’ had any meaning for him.
He deeply admired Wordsworth, and regarded <i>The
Excursion</i> as one of the three things to rejoice at
in that age; but it was Wordsworth as an interpreter
of human life, the poet who ‘thought into
the human heart’ (to Reynolds, May 1818), rather
than the mountain lover. There is no clear trace
as yet in his earlier poetry of Cumberland fells;
there is none whatever of the great mountain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
mythology of Wordsworth. No menacing peak
had ever towered up between him and the stars,
no far-distant hills had sent an alien sound of
melancholy to his ear. Not that he owes nothing as
a poet to the mythic rendering of mountains. On
the contrary, up to this date, all his imagining of
mountains, in the stricter sense, is derived from,
or at least touched with, myth. Only it is the
myth of classic legend, not of modern ‘natural
religion.’ Had not the ‘lively Grecians’ inhabited
a ‘land of hills,’ these would hardly
have entered even as largely as they do into the
enchanted scenery of <i>Endymion</i>; and on the
whole it is a scenery of woods and waters, flowery
glades and ocean caverns, not of Olympian heights.
But if Keats’s experience of nature is still limited,
it is used to the full. <i>Endymion</i>, at first sight a
tissue of exquisite dreams, is full of the evidence
of his no less exquisite perception of the living
nature within his reach. From the very outset
we are aware that the ‘things of beauty’ he
loved best and knew most intimately in the natural
world were woods and flowers and streams. There
is no mention, in that opening survey, of hills,
and when they come perforce into the story they
are arrayed as far as may be in the semblance of
these beloved things. ‘A mighty forest’ is
‘outspread upon the sides of Latmus’ (i. 62);
in the summons to the Shepherds, the highland
homes are touched vaguely and without interest
(‘whether descended from beneath the
rocks that overtop your mountains’), while he
lingers with evident delight upon the ‘swelling
downs’</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">The ideal dwelling for Endymion and his ‘swan
of Ganges’ will be under the brow of a steep hill,
but they will be embowered in ivy and yew,
and the hill itself, like their bridal couch, will
be ‘mossy’—the haunting character of the
Keatsian woodland and its ‘winding ways’
(iv. 670).</p>

<p>On the other hand, some of the hills in
<i>Endymion</i>, like ‘fountain’d Helicon,’ are purely
legendary, and the higher and bolder ones derive
their characters from the tales of Olympus or
Cyllene. Between nature and classic myth there
was for Keats no trace of the disparity which so
deeply offended Wordsworth; his imagination
passed without thought of discord from one to
the other, or blended them together; it was
probably the Nature poet yet more than the
Christian in Wordsworth who responded so coldly
(‘A pretty piece of paganism’) when the young
poet brought his train of Bacchanals ‘over the
light-blue hills.’ It is of Arcadian boar-hunts
that we have to think when Endymion on the
mountain-heights will ‘once more make his horn
parley from their foreheads hoar’ (i. 478), or sees
the thunderbolt hurled from his threshold (ii. 203);
it is an Arcadian shepherd whose ‘pipe comes
clear from aery steep’ (iii. 359). And it is at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
least no English mountain of whose ‘icy pinnacles’
we have a momentary and here quite isolated
glimpse.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>But while the mountain-drawing in <i>Endymion</i>
is on the whole vague and derivative, there are
hints that Keats was already becoming alive to
the imaginative spell of great mountains, to
their power in poetry, and for his poetry. When
he imagines the moonlit earth, he sees it partly
in delicate miniature like the image of the nested
wren, who takes glimpses of the moon from beneath
a sheltering ivy-leaf, but this is coupled with a
picture of Miltonic grandeur and tumult:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Innumerable mountains rise, and rise,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ambitious for the hallowing of thine eyes. (iii. 59.)</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">He was already on the way to that clear recognition
of his need of great mountains which speaks
from his famous explanation of the motives of the
northern tour which he undertook, with Brown,
in the summer of 1818—the crucial event of his
history from our present point of view. ‘I
should not have consented to myself,’ he wrote
to Bailey, ‘these four months tramping in the
highlands, but that I thought that it would give
me more experience, rub off more prejudice, use
me to more hardship, identify finer scenes, load
me with grander mountains, and strengthen more
my reach in Poetry, than would stopping at home
among books, even though I should read Homer.’<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
The passage has great psychological value, for it
shows how closely involved his nascent apprehension
of mountains was with the other spiritual
appetencies urgent within him in these months.
To be ‘loaded with grander mountains’ he thought
of as an integral part of an inner process of much
wider scope, of which the common note was to be
the bracing and hardening of a mind which had
not yet won complete control of its supreme gift
of exquisite sensation. The ‘grander mountains’
were to be only one of the bracing forces, but it
is clear that he felt this new force, under whose
sway he was for a while about to live, akin to
others which his letters show to have been alluring
him during these months. The bare rugged forms
of the mountains he was now to explore accorded
subtly for him with the hardihood and endurance
of the climber, and not less with the severity of
the epic poet, who, like Milton, preferred ‘the
ardours to the pleasures of song,’ or who, like
Homer, allowed us fugitive but sublime glimpses
of the mountains which looked down upon the
scene of his Tale. When Keats and Brown came
down upon the town of Ayr, they had before
them ‘a grand Sea view terminated by the black
Mountains of the isle of Arran. As soon as I
saw them so nearly I said to myself: How is it
they did not beckon Burns to some grand attempt
at Epic?’<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> Keats perhaps thought of the Isle
of Tenedos, which similarly dominates the plain
of Troy across a reach of sea; ‘You would lift
your eyes from Homer only to see close before
you the real Isle of Tenedos,’ he was writing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
Reynolds in a different context on the same day.
That one peaked Isle should stand out in Keats’s
mind from all the other imagery of Homer, and
that he should wonder at the failure of another
to beget new Iliads in the unhomeric Burns, shows
with much precision how his literary passion for
the Homeric poetry was now quickened and actualized
by the visible presence of grand mountains.</p>

<p>It is needless (though not irrelevant) to dwell
here upon other kindred features of the expanding
horizons which came into view for Keats in this
momentous year: the resolve to renounce his
‘luxurious’ art for philosophy and knowledge;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
and the disdain for women, for effeminate characters,
for the pleasures of domesticity. In each
case the urgency of this passion for what he felt
more bracing, more intellectually fortifying, more
masculine, found vent, for a time, in language
too peremptory and exclusive to be true to the
needs of his rich and complex nature.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> Philosophy
would, had he lived, assuredly have ministered
more abundantly to his poetry, but <i>Lamia</i> shows
how far she was from becoming its master, or its
substitute; the Miltonic ardours of <i>Hyperion</i> were
to be qualified in the renewed but chastened and
ennobled ‘luxury’ of <i>St. Agnes’ Eve</i> and the
<i>Odes</i>. The man who wrote: ‘the roaring of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
the wind is my wife and the stars through the
windowpane are my children,’ would yet have
found a place for noble womanhood within his
‘masculine’ ideal, had not a tragical influence
intervened. And, similarly, the traces of his
mountain experience fade after 1818, a new order
of symbols, more congenial at bottom to the
ways of his imagination, asserts or reasserts itself
in his poetry; and it is hardly an accident that
in the revised <i>Hyperion</i> of a year later we approach
the granite precipices and everlasting cataracts of
the original poem by way of a garden, a temple,
and a shrine.</p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>For, evidently, it is in <i>Hyperion</i>, if anywhere,
that we have to seek the afterglow of that experience
of ‘grander mountains’ which, in June, he
had set out to encounter. We must not indeed
look in poetry of this quality for those detailed
reproductions of what he had seen which Wordsworth
condemned as ‘inventories’ in Scott, but
which are not strange either to the lower levels
of his own verse. Even in the letters written for
the entertainment of a sick brother Keats rarely
describes; and constantly, to others, he breaks
off impatiently when he has begun. ‘My dear
Reynolds—I cannot write about scenery and
visitings.’ His impressions come from him in
brief, sudden, unsought phrases; he left it to the
methodic Brown to give the enchanting and
‘picturesque’ detail of mountains and valleys
‘in the manner of the Laputan printing-press.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
‘I have been among wilds and mountains too
much to break out much about their grandeur,’
he writes a little later to Bailey. But there is no
doubt of the impression. He had hoped that his
experience would ‘load’ him with grander mountains;
and, in fact, as he goes on to tell, ‘The
first mountains I saw, though not so large as some
I have since seen, <i>weighed</i> very solemnly upon me.’
And Brown tells us that when Windermere first
burst upon their view, ‘he stopped as if stupefied
with beauty.’<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Their actual experiences of mountain-climbing
were few. Weather checked them at Helvellyn,
and expense at Ben Lomond; but in the ‘bleak
air atop’ of Skiddaw, as Lamb had called it,
‘I felt as if I were going to a Tournament.’
What he felt about the Arran mountains we have
seen. Ailsa Craig—the seafowl-haunted ‘craggy
ocean pyramid,’ evoked ‘the only sonnet of any
worth I have of late written.’ They found the
north end of Loch Lomond ‘grand to excess,’
and Keats made a rude pen-and-ink sketch of
‘that blue place among the mountains.’ But
their greatest experience was doubtless the climb
on Ben Nevis, on 2 August. The chasms below
the summit of Nevis seemed to him ‘the most
tremendous places I have ever seen,’ ‘the finest
wonder of the whole—they appear great rents in
the very heart of the mountain, ... other huge
crags rising round ... give the appearance to
Nevis of a shattered heart or core in itself.’</p>

<p>The plan of a poem on the war of the gods and
Titans was already shaped or shaping in his mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
when Keats set out for the north. As early as
September 1817 he had had in view ‘a new
romance’ for the following summer; in keeping
with the new aspirations which that summer
brought, the ‘romance’ was now to be an epic.
The most potent influence governing the execution,
that of Milton, is familiar, and does not directly
concern us here. Still less can we consider the
possible effect of companionship with those three
little volumes of Cary’s <i>Dante</i>, the single book
taken with him on this tour.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> But while the
spell of <i>Paradise Lost</i> is apparent in the cast of
the plot, above all in the debate of the Titans,
and in the style, an influence to which Milton’s
is wholly alien asserts itself in the delineation of
the Titanic ‘den’ itself. Clearly based upon
the idea of an Inferno, this ‘sad place’ where
‘bruised Titans’ are ‘chained in torture,’ is
yet full of traits which recall neither Milton nor
Dante, but rather one of those amazing chasms on
Nevis, which seemed to be the very ‘core’ of
the great mountain. He had, even, as he looked
down into that vaporous gulf, actually thought
of the image of Hell. Milton’s Hell is a plain of
burning earth vaulted with fire and verging on a
sea of flame<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>; if there is a hill (i. 670) it is a
volcano, belching fire, or coated with a sulphurous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
scurf. The Keatsian Inferno is genuinely, what he
calls it, a ‘den,’ a yawning mountain dungeon
overarched with jutting crags, floored with hard
flint and slaty ridge, and encompassed by a deafening
roar of waterfalls and torrents. A shattered
rib of rock, with his iron mace beside it, attests
the spent fury of Creus. Enceladus lies uneasily
upon a craggy shelf. To render the spectacle of
the ruined and almost lifeless bodies lying ‘vast
and edgeways,’ he calls in a definite reminiscence,
the ‘dismal cirque’ of Druid stones near Keswick.
He has felt too the silence of the mountains in the
pauses of the winter wind, though he speaks of it
only to contrast it with the organ voice of Saturn
preceding the expectant murmur of his audience
of fallen divinities (ii. 123).<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The darkness, too,
in which they languish is not eternal and ordained
like that of Milton’s Hell; the coming of the
Sun-god will invade it with a splendour like the
morn and</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">will stand revealed in that terrible splendour.</p>

<p>It is clear that in this great passage Keats has
deliberately invoked the image of a sunrise among
precipitous mountains; and these lines assure him
a lasting place amongst our poet interpreters of
mountain glory. We must beware, as we have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
seen, of overstressing the element of realism in
the poem. Keats was not <i>describing</i> mountain
scenery, English, Scotch, or any other, but using
certain aspects of it, which had been vividly
brought home to him as he climbed or trudged,
to render poetic inspirations of far richer compass
and wider scope. Much of the detail of this Titan
prison belongs as little to his British mountain
experience as do the Titans themselves. Iapetus
grasps a strangled serpent; Asia, dreaming of
palm-shaded temples and sacred isles, leans upon
an elephant tusk. We are conscious of no discord,
so pervading is the impress of a single potent
imagination, whatever the material it employs.
But it is not immaterial to note that, as Professor
de Sélincourt has pointed out, Keats did alter the
original draft of Hyperion’s coming in such a way
as to give it a close resemblance to a sunrise among
the mountains, omitting two lines which preceded
the last but one quoted above:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">And all the Caverns soft with moss and weed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or dazzling with bright and barren gems.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">The former of these lines may be described as a
momentary reversion to the tender ‘mossy’
luxuriance of the <i>Endymion</i> scenery, like the
‘nest of pain’ (ii. 90), which, however, he allowed
to stand.<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> Its excision, in the final version, marks
Keats’s sense of the incongruity of that earlier
symbolism with the sterner matter in hand, as
does the transformation of the dreamy, pastoral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
Oceanus of the earlier poem into the master of
Stoic wisdom, able ‘to bear all naked truths, and
to envisage circumstance, all calm,’ who offers
his bitter balm to the despairing Titans, in the
later.</p>

<p><i>Hyperion</i>, we know, was left a fragment, and
with deliberate purpose. The mighty shade of
Milton, he came to feel, deflected him from his
proper purpose in poetry. It is less important,
but not less true, that his passing vision of grand
mountains was not in complete consonance with
his genius, and that his brief anthem of mountain
poetry had in it something of the nature of a
<i>tour de force</i>. The mountains were for him neither
strongholds of faith nor sources of sublime consolation.
Even in the letters written in their
presence he could speak somewhat impatiently,
as we have seen, of ‘scenery’ compared with
life and men. And if he places his ruined Titans
in this wild den among the crags and torrents, it
is because there was something in him, deeper
than his reverence for Wordsworth or for mountain
grandeur, which felt the very savagery of the
scene, its naked aloofness from everything human,
to be in accord with the primeval rudeness of an
outdone and superseded race. It is not for
nothing that, when the scene changes from the
old order to the new, we are transported from
Hyperion’s sun-smitten precipices to the sea-haunted
lawns and woodlands of Delos, where
the young Apollo is seen wandering forth in
the morning twilight</p>

<p class="drop-capi">MAZZINI, the most prophetic figure of the
nineteenth century, declared in a famous
passage his confidence in the European mission
of his country. ‘The Third Italy,’ destined to
be born of the long agony of the struggle with
Austria without and the papacy within, was not
merely to be a nation, restored to unity and independence;
it was to intervene as an original
voice in the complex harmony of the European
nationalities, contributing of its own inborn genius
something distinctive and unique. ‘We believe
devoutly that Italy has not exhausted her life
in the world. She is called to introduce yet
new elements in the progressive development of
humanity, and to live with a third life. It is for
us to begin it.’ Were Mazzini to return to life
to-day, how far would he regard his prophecy as
fulfilled? Beyond question his lofty idealism
would find much to disapprove and to regret.
He would find a Third Italy, which has committed
grave excesses in the name of her recovered
nationhood. But he would also find a nation
whose present rulers have shown more capacity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
for Mazzinean internationalism than any other
European government. And he would find, also,
in the Third Italy, a real renascence, a genuine
rebirth of genius and power, and this in ways so
individual as to justify in a rare degree the anticipation
that Italy would give something vitally
her own to the new Europe. Open any serious
Italian book to-day, and you will note a kind of
intellectual concentration, a girding up of the
loins of speech and thought, in striking contrast
with the loose-tongued volubility of most Italian
writing, in verse or prose, of the mid-nineteenth
century. You note also a new tone of critical
mastery and conscious equality. Italy in the last
century was still the ‘woman-people,’ the
pathetic beauty, languid still after the gentle
torpor of two centuries, and whose intellectual
life, with some brilliant isolated exceptions, faintly
reflected that of the more masculine nations north
of the Alps. To-day she has not only critically
mastered all that Europe has to give, she sits in
judgment upon us, and the judgment she pronounces
has again and again been of that fruitful
kind which disposes of old difficulties by revealing
a larger law. Benedetto Croce, who in his
review, the <i>Critica</i>, brings the literature of Europe,
weighed and measured, to his reader’s doors, has
in his original philosophic work subjected her philosophic
systems to a searching revision, and has
succeeded in some measure to their authority.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> A
thinker less known, even to cultivated Italians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
Aliotta, has surveyed in a book of singular penetration
and philosophic power, the ‘idealistic reaction
against science’ in the nineteenth century. And
when we look to creative literature, we find in this
Third Italy, together with a profusion of those fungoid
growths of which the modern age has in the
West been everywhere prolific, a group of poets,
of powerful temperament and dazzling gifts, to
whom no predecessor, in Italy or elsewhere, offers
more than a distant resemblance. One of these,
after pouring forth poems, dramas, novels, in
prodigal abundance for thirty years, became the
most vociferous, and possibly the most potent,
of the forces that drove Italy into the war, and
was until lately the idol of the whole Italian race.
Even to-day, after the sorry collapse of his adventure,
the man in whom Europe, irritated and
impatient, sees only a sort of Harlequin-Garibaldi,
impudent where his predecessor was sublime, and
florid where he was laconic, is still, for multitudes
of his countrymen, the hero-poet who took the
banner of <i>Italianità</i> from the failing or treacherous
hands of diplomats and statesmen, and defended it
against the enemy without and the enemy within,
with the tenacity of maturity and the ardour of
youth. Certainly, one who is beyond all rivalry
the most adored poet, in any country, of our time,
who has fought for Italy with tongue and pen
and risked his life in her service, and whose personality
might be called a brilliant impressionist
sketch of the talents and failings of the Italian
character, reproducing some in heightened but
veracious illumination, others in glaring caricature
or paradoxical distortion—such a man, as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
national no less than as a literary force, claims
and deserves close study.</p>

<p>Before entering, however, upon the detail of
his life and work, let me assist our imagination
of Gabriele d’Annunzio by quoting from the vivid
description given by Mr. James Bone of a meeting
with him at Venice in the summer of 1918. The
poet, fifty-six years old, was then at the height
of his renown; Fiume was still unthought of.
His great exploit of flying over Vienna and dropping
leaflets inviting her in aureate imagery to
make peace was on every tongue. The gondoliers
took off their hats as they passed his house on the
Grand Canal, and he had to register all his letters
to prevent their being abstracted as souvenirs.
Mr. Bone was talking with the airmen at an aerodrome
on one of the islands in the lagoons; when
‘Conversation died instantly as an airman, very
different from the others, came hurrying towards
us a rather small, very quick, clean-cut figure,
wearing large smoked glasses and white gloves
with the wrists turned down.... The nose was
rather prominent, complexion not dark but marked
a little, the whole profile very clear, making one
think not of a Renaissance Italian but of a type
more antique, an impression accentuated by his
rather large, beautifully shaped ear, very close to
the head. The body denied the age that was
told in the face, for all its firmness. One’s first
impression was of a personality of extraordinary
swiftness and spirit still at full pressure, remorselessly
pursuing its course “in hours of insight
willed.”... The whole surface of d’Annunzio’s
personality suggested a rich, hard fineness, like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
those unpolished marbles in old Italian churches
that gleam delicately near the base where the
worshippers have touched them, but above rise
cold and white as from the matrix.... There
was something of the man of fashion in the way
he wore his gloves, and in his gestures, but nothing
one could see of the national idol aware of
itself.’<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>The soldier-poet-man-of-fashion, who wore his
fifty-six years thus lightly, was born, in 1862, at
Pescara, the chief—almost only—town of the
Abruzzi, then one of the wildest and rudest provinces
of Italy. Its valleys, descending from the
eastern heights of the Apennines to the Adriatic,
were inhabited by an almost purely peasant
population—a hardy, vigorous race, tenacious of
their primitive customs, and little accessible to
cultural influences. The Church enjoyed their
fanatical devotion, but only at the price of tacitly
accepting many immemorial pagan usages disguised
by an unusually transparent veil of Catholic
ritual; while the Law occasionally found it expedient
to leave a convicted murderer (as in the
<i>Figlia di Iorio</i>) to be executed by an angry
multitude according to the savage methods their
tradition prescribed. The little haven of Pescara—one
of the few on Italy’s featureless Adriatic
coast—was the centre of a coasting traffic with
the yet wilder Dalmatian seaboard, a traffic which
like all ancient sea-faring, pursued its economic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
aims in an atmosphere of superstitious observance,
mystical, picturesque, and sometimes cruel. In
the poetic autobiography (‘The Soul’s Journey’)
which occupies the first <i>Laude</i> (1903), d’Annunzio
sketches vividly his boyhood’s home in this
Abruzzan country overlooking the sea. Of the
persons who composed this home, of family affections,
we have only momentary retrospective
glimpses. We hear of the father, long dead
when he wrote, from whom he derived his iron-tempered
muscles; and of the mother, who gave
him his insatiable ardour of will and desire. The
three sisters seem to have been like him; the
face of the second sister resembled his own
‘mirrored in a clear fountain at dawn.’ All
that stood between them, he says, was their
innocence and his passion. There was, too, an
old nurse, to whom in her serene old age, when
she had retired to a mountain hamlet, the poet
addressed some tenderly beautiful stanzas, contrasting
his own stormy career with her idyllic
peace as she ‘spins the wool of her own flocks
while the oil holds out.’<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>But of household drama, such as dominates the
experience of most children, little seems to have
existed for this child. Certainly it vanishes completely,
in the retrospect of the man of forty,
beside the drama enacted with prodigious intensity
of colour, animation, and passion, by his imperious
senses. The contrast is here acute between
d’Annunzio and his co-heir of the Carduccian
tradition, Pascoli, whose poignant memories of
childhood, instead of being effaced by the energy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
of his sense-life, permeate it through and through,
giving a ‘deep autumnal tone’ to almost every
line he wrote. He spoke in later life of his ‘profound
sensuality’ as a gift which had brought
him poetic discoveries denied to colder men, and
this is no doubt true if by ‘sensuality’ we understand,
as we ought, that d’Annunzio is prodigally
endowed with all the senses, that eye and ear
feast on the glory and the music of the world
and live in its teeming life, that his lithe body
thrills with the zest of motion, that imagery is
the material of his thinking and the stuff of his
speech; and that the passion of sex, so acutely
and perilously developed in him, is just one
element in this prodigal endowment of his entire
sense-organism, itself a main source of the
artistic splendour of his work. In the early pages
of the <i>Viaggio</i> we see the young boy drinking in
with a kind of intoxication the simple sights and
sounds of the farm—the rhythmic fall of the flails
on the threshing-floor, the pouring of the whey
from the churn, the whirr of the spool in the loom,
the scampering of wild ponies with streaming
manes over the hillside; or again, out at sea, the
gorgeous scarlet or gold sails scudding before the
wind, each with its symbolic sign. Even the
inanimate world became for his transfiguring
senses alive; ‘it was a lying voice,’ he cries,
‘that declared that Pan is dead.’ The mere
contrasts of things, the individual self-assertion
shown by a tree, for instance, in not being a rock,
produced in him an excitement analogous to
that which made Rupert Brooke, in his own
words, ‘a lover’ of all kinds of common things<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
for being just definitely and unmistakably what
they were. So that a conception apparently so
thin and abstract as ‘difference’ can assume for
him the shape and potency of an alluring divinity:
‘Diversity,’ he cries, ‘the siren of the world!
I am he who love thee!’</p>

<p>And then, with adolescence, came the passion
of sex; for d’Annunzio no shy and gradual discovery,
but a veritable explosion, before which
all obstacles, moral and material, vanished into
air. He tells it with the frankness of a child of
the South, and the self-conscious importance of
an egoist for whom the events of his own physical
history could only be fitly described in terms of
epic poetry, with its contending nationalities
and ruined or triumphant kings. ‘O flesh!’ he
cries, ‘I gave myself up to thee, as a young
beardless king gives himself up to the warrior
maid who advances in arms, terrible and beautiful.
She advances victorious, and the people receive
her with rejoicing. Astonishment strikes the
gentle king, and his hope laughs at his fear.’<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
And from the first this new passion allies itself
with the rest of his sense-organism, irradiating
eye and ear and imagination, ‘giving to every
power a double power,’ as Biron says in <i>Love’s
Labour’s Lost</i>. ‘Thou wast sometimes as the
grape pressed by fiery feet, O flesh, sometimes as
snow printed with bleeding traces; I seemed to
feel in thee the twisting of trodden roots, and to
hear the far-off grinding of the axe upon the
whetstone.’ The young erotic was already growing
towards that observant psychologist of eroticism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
who pervades so many gorgeous but repulsive pages
of his novels.</p>

<p>He was also growing, more slowly and as yet
invisibly, to other and more notable things. In
the first published poems of the boy of eighteen,
and the second, <i>Canto Novo</i>, two years later,
there is not much more than the reflexion of this
intense and pervading ‘sensuality’ (in the large
meaning above indicated), in a speech moulded
upon the diction and rhythms of Carducci. The
great master, then at the height of his fame,
had still to do much of his most splendid work.
D’Annunzio, who never ceased to revere him, was
to become his principal inheritor; but the heir
added so much of his own to the bequest that he
can only at the outset be regarded as his disciple.
The elder poet’s influence was in any case entirely
salutary. The classical severity and nobility of
style which distinguish the <i>Rime Nove</i> and the
<i>Odi Barbare</i> from the florid and facile romantic
verse of the day, contributed to temper the
dangerous luxuriance of d’Annunzio, and to evoke
the powers of self-discipline and tenacious will
which lay within; while Carducci’s exultation in
radiance and clarity, his noonday view of life,
his symbolic sun-worship and his hatred of all
twilight obscurantism and moonlight nebulosity,
equally enforced the more virile strain in d’Annunzio,
the ‘stalk of carle’s hemp’ which, far more truly
than in Burns, underlay the voluptuous senses.</p>

<p>This background of harder and tougher nature
was already manifested when d’Annunzio, a few
years later, turned to tell in prose some stories
of his native province. There is little in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
<i>Novelle della Pescara</i> of love, less of luxury or refinement;
we see the Abruzzan village folk at feud,
fanatical and ferocious, the women inciting the
men, the Church in its most ceremonial robes
blandly but helplessly looking on. <i>The Idolators</i>
tells how the men of a certain village plan to
set the bronze statue of their saint upon the
church altar of another neighbouring village. They
assemble at night and march through the darkness
with the image on a cart. In the other village
the men await them in force, and a savage battle
takes place in the church, ending in the rout
of the assailants with much slaughter, and the
ignominious mutilation of the image of their
patron saint. And all this grim matter is told
in a style admirably strong and terse, bold and
sharp in outline, direct and impersonal in statement,
untouched by either delicate feeling or weak
sentimentality. D’Annunzio’s sensuality asserts
itself still, as always; but it appears here as
a Rubens-like joy in intense impressions; now
a copper-coloured storm sky, now a splash of
blood, betrays his passion for the crude effects
of flame and scarlet, most often where they signify
death or ruin. He imagines voluptuously as
always, but his voluptuousness here feeds not in
the lust of the flesh, but in the lust of wounds
and death. When he describes the fighting in
the church, he spares you as little as Homer;
you are not told merely that a man was stabbed,
you are made to see the blade shear away the
flesh from the bone. His men are drawn with
the same hard, pungent stroke, and a visible
relish for scars, gnarled features, frayed dress,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
and all the maimings and deformities, which tell
not of weakness or decay, but of battles recent or
long ago, the blows and buffets received in the
tug with fortune. There is little trace of sybarite
effeminacy in the painting of old Giacobbe, for
instance, the leader of the insurgents, a tall,
bony man, with bald crown and long red hairs
on nape and temples, two front teeth wanting,
which gave him a look of senile ferocity, a pointed
chin covered with bristles, and so forth.</p>

<p>D’Annunzio was intrinsically of the Abruzzan
race; the tough hardy fibre of the peasant folk was
his; and it was the deep inborn attachment to his
blood and kin which produced, twenty years later,
his greatest work, as a like attachment lifted Mr.
Shaw, almost at the same moment, to the rare
heights of <i>John Bull’s Other Island</i>. But much
had to happen to the young provincial before he
could thus discover to the full the poetry of his
province.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>In the early eighties d’Annunzio had come to
Rome. The little circle of young Carduccians in
the capital welcomed the poet’s brilliant disciple,
who was soon to outdistance them all in sheer
splendour of literary gift. More important, however,
than any literary or personal influence—for
his hard encasing shell of egoism made him extraordinarily
immune to the intrusion either of alien
genius or of friendship or love—was the deep impression
made upon the young Abruzzan by the splendour,
the art glories, and above all the
historic import of Rome. ‘The Abruzzi gave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
d’Annunzio the sense of <i>race</i>‘, says an excellent
critic, ‘Rome gave him the sense of <i>history</i>.’
The magical effect of Rome had hitherto been
rendered most vividly in the poetry of other
peoples, to whom it was a revelation, or a fulfilment
of long aspiration, of the ‘city of their
soul,’ in Goethe’s <i>Roman Elegies</i>, <i>Childe Harold</i>,
or <i>Adonais</i>. How overwhelming to an imaginative
Italian the sight and living presence of Rome
could be may be judged from the magnificent
<i>Ode</i> of Carducci. The Englishman who is thrilled as
he stands in the Forum, or by the mossy bastions
of our own Roman wall, may faintly apprehend
the temper of a citizen of the ‘Third Italy’ who
felt his capital, newly won from the Popes, to be
once more in living continuity with the city of
Cæsar. Both the nobility and the extravagance
of Italian national feeling have their root in this
sense of continuity with antique Rome, and this
is to be remembered in estimating the perfervid
<i>Italianità</i> of d’Annunzio, the most striking example
both of the sublime idealism and of the childish
extravagance which it is able to inspire.</p>

<p>The work of the next years abounded in evidence
of the spell which Rome had laid upon his
sensuous imagination. He poured forth novels and
poems, both charged with an oppressive opulence
of epicurean and erotic detail, but saved for
art by the clear-cut beauty of the prose, and by
frequent strokes of bold and splendid imagination.</p>

<p>Andrea Sperelli in <i>Il Piacere</i> (1889) and Tullio
Hermil in <i>L’Innocente</i> (1892), are virtuosos in
æsthetic as well as in erotic luxury, and the two
allied varieties of hedonism reflect and enforce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
one another. Sperelli is artist and connoisseur, of
unlimited resources and opportunities, and neither
he nor his mistress could think love tolerable
in chambers not hung with precious tapestry and
adorned with sculptured gold and silver vessels,
the gift of queens or cardinals of the splendour-loving
Renascence. No doubt there is irony in
the picture too; the native stamina in d’Annunzio
resists complete assimilation to the corrupt aspects
of the luxury he describes, and he feels keenly the
contrast between the riotous profusion of the
‘new rich’ of the new Rome and the heroism
and hardships of the men of the <i>Risorgimento</i>
who had won it.</p>

<p>The poetry of this period is less repellent because
its substance, though not definitely larger or
deeper, is sustained and penetrated by the magic
of a wonderfully winged and musical speech. His
<i>Elegie Romane</i> (1892)—a rare case of his emulating
another poet—are inferior in intellectual force to
Goethe’s, which yet have as lyrics an almost
pedestrian air in comparison with the exquisite
dance of the Italian rhythms. Here is one of
d’Annunzio’s, in some approach to the original
elegiacs. He has listened to a service in St. Peter’s:</p>

<p>The sonnets of the <i>Isottèo</i> and <i>Chimera</i> (1885-8)
show a concentration rare in the later history of
the Italian sonnet. And any reader who thinks
d’Annunzio incapable of writing of love without
offence may be invited to try the charming idyll
of Isaotta Guttadàuro. Scenery and circumstances,
to be sure, are sumptuous and opulent as
usual. The simple life and homely persons traditional
in idyll are remote; but poetry did not
absolutely fly from Tennyson’s touch when he
turned from his Miller’s and Gardener’s daughters
to put Maud in a Hall; and neither does she
retire from d’Annunzio’s Isaotta, in her noble
mansion. The lover stands at sunrise in the
‘high hall garden’ under her window and summons
her in a joyous morning song to come forth. It
is late autumn, the house is silent, but the peacocks
perched on the orange trees hail the morning in
their raucous tones. The situation is that of
Herrick’s May morning song to Corinna; but though
Herrick loved jewels and fine dresses not a little,
the contrast is piquant between the country
simplicity of his Devonshire maids and men,
and the aristocratic luxury of Isaotta. ‘Come,
my Corinna, come! Wash, dress, be brief in
praying’—bids Herrick; but no such summary
toilette will serve the Italian. Isaotta will rise
from her brocaded bed, and her white limbs will
gleam in a marble bath, as her maid pours<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
amber-scented water on them, while the woven
figures of the story of Omphale look on from the
walls. At length Isaotta comes out on to her
vine-wreathed balcony and playfully greets <i>messèr
cantore</i> below. She is secretly ready, we see, to
surrender, but makes a show of standing out for
terms. They will wander through the autumnal
vineyards, and if they find a single cluster still
hanging on the poles, ‘I will yield to your desire,
and you shall be my lord.’ So they set out in
the November morning. The vineyards, lately so
loud with vintage merriment and song, are now
deserted and still. Not a cluster is to be seen.
She archly mocks him: ‘What, has subtle Love
no power to give you eyes?’ They meet peasant
women going to their work, and one of them asks
him, ‘What seekest thou, fair sir?’ And he
replies: ‘I seek a treasure.’ A flight of birds
rises suddenly across their path with joyous cries;
they take it as a sign, and gaze at each other, pale
and silent. Then unexpectedly he sees before him
a vineyard flaming in full array of purple and
gold, and a flock of birds making a chorus in its
midst. “‘O lady Isaotta, here is life!’ I cried
to her with rapt soul; and the chorus of songsters
cried over our heads. I drew her to the spot,
and she came as swift as I, for I held her firmly
by the hand. Rosy was the face she turned away
from me, but fair as Blanchemain’s when she
took the kiss of Lancelot, her sovran lover, in
the forest. ‘O Lady, I keep my pact; for you
I pluck the fatal untouched cluster.’ Then she
gave me the kiss divine”.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The last word of the Isaotta idyll—<i>sovrumano</i>—rendered
above ‘divine,’ was an early symptom
of a development of formidable significance in
the prose and poetry of d’Annunzio during the
next twenty years. The ‘Superman’ had not
yet been discovered when he was a boy, but the
spirit to which <i>sovrumanità</i> appeals had from the
first run in his blood. His passion for sensation,
for strong effects, for energy, even for ferocity
and cruelty, was the concomitant of a genius
that strove to shatter obstacles, to bend others
to its will, and reshape its experience, as the
opposite genius of Pascoli submissively accepted
experience, hearing in all its vicissitudes reverberations
of the mournful memories in which his
soul was steeped. When d’Annunzio accordingly,
in the early nineties, discovered the work of
Nietzsche, he experienced that liberation which
comes to every man who meets with a coherent
exposition of the meaning of his own blind impulses,
and a great new word for his confused and inarticulate
aims. In Nietzsche he found a mind
more congenial to him perhaps than any other he
had known, more even than that of his master
Carducci, but, unlike his, congenial mainly to
what was most perilous and ill-omened in himself.
He loftily admitted the German his equal, a
great concession, and when Nietzsche died, in
1900, wrote a noble dirge ‘to the memory of a
destroyer,’—of the <i>Barbaro enorme</i> ‘who lifted up
again the serene gods of Hellas on to the vast
gates of the Future.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span></p>

<p>When d’Annunzio wrote these words the Hellenic
enthusiasms, nourished by his acute sense of
beauty in a nature utterly wanting in the Hellenic
poise, had won, partly through Nietzsche’s influence,
an ascendancy over his imagination which
made it natural for him to render the Superman
in Hellenic terms. The serene gods of Hellas
symbolized for him the calmness of absolute
mastery, of complete conquest, all enemies
trampled under foot or flung to the eternal torments
of Erebus. This mood detached him wholly from
Shelley, and Byron, and the young Goethe. They
had gloried in Prometheus, the spirit of man
struggling against supreme deity on its Olympian
heights, and finally overthrowing it; whereas
d’Annunzio, like the riper Goethe, adores the secure
serenity of Olympus. ‘O Zeus, Father of Serene
Day, how much fairer than the chained and
howling Iapetid seemed in thy eyes the silent
mountain and its vast buttresses fresh with invisible
springs.’ And besides Prometheus, Zeus has
another enemy, Christ—the foe of beauty, and lord
of the herd of slaves with their slave-morality
of pity and submission. ‘O Zeus, he cries, I
invoke thee, awaken and bring on the Morrow!
Make the fire of heaven thy ploughshare to
plough the Night! Thou only canst purify Earth
from its piled-up filth.’</p>

<p>We are not to look in all this for even so much
of definite ethical or philosophic content as we
find in Nietzsche. If Nietzsche was a poet imagining
in philosophic terms rather than a philosopher,
d’Annunzio was hardly capable of abstract thought
at all. On the other hand, Nietzsche could still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
less rival d’Annunzio in creative faculty, and the
series of d’Annunzian characters inspired or touched
by the spirit of Nietzschean <i>sovrumanità</i> may be
set against the richer intellectual and spiritual
substance of <i>Zarathustra</i>. No doubt this influence
was in the main disastrous for him; Nietzsche’s
heady draught intoxicated his brain with visions
of colossal and ruthless power, begetting images
of supermen and superwomen magnificent in
stature and equipment, in the glory of their flame-like
hair, and the crystalline beauty of their speech,
but wholly unreal and impossible. Nevertheless,
there were fortunate moments when the vision of
power was constrained by a human and moving
story to work within the limits of humanity.
And these moments, though few, atoned for much
splendid futility.</p>

<p>Moreover, his vision of power came to include,
at moments, the bridling of his own
infirmities. There was always the making of a
soldier in the Abruzzan before he became one.
He was capable of an asceticism amazing to those
who know only the hothouse atmosphere of his
novels. Some of his most sumptuous prose and
verse was poured forth in the naked seclusion
of monastic cells, or in wild peasant houses far
from civilization; and only the most iron industry
could have achieved the enormous bulk of his
work.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Hence he can put into the mouth of
Claudio Cantelmo, in the <i>Vergini</i>, these evidently
autobiographic words: ‘After subduing the
tumults of youth, I examined whether perchance
... my will could, by choice and exclusion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
extract a new and seemly work of its own from
the elements which life had stored up within me.’
There is a glimpse here of a finer psychological
and a deeper ethical insight than we often find
in d’Annunzio, and it might have led a man of
richer spiritual capacity to a loftier poetry than
he was ever to produce.</p>

<p>But on the whole the clue thus hinted was not
followed up, and the tough nerve which might
have nourished the powerful controlling will of a
supreme artist, often served only to sustain those
enormities of the ferocious and the grandiose
which make dramas like <i>Gloria</i> and <i>La Nave</i>
mere examples of the pathology of genius.</p>

<p>We touch here the crucial point. For these extravagances
were not mere momentary aberrations.
They were but the more pronounced manifestations
of fundamental deficiencies in the man,
which in their turn impoverish and dwarf the
poet. D’Annunzio, in one word, is wanting in
humanity; and because of his shallow and fragmentary
apprehension of the human soul, his
vision of power and beauty discharges itself in
barren spectacles of brute energy and material
splendour, for which he cannot find psychological
equivalents in grandeur or loveliness of character.
Shakespeare’s huge personalities—Othello, Lear,
Antony—are human in every trait, however much
they transcend our actual experience of men.
D’Annunzio tries to make violent actions and
abnormal passions produce the illusion of greatness
of soul, and disguises his psychological poverty by
the sustained coruscations of his lyric speech.</p>

<p>In the meantime novels and poems and dramas<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
poured forth. The prolific later nineties saw the
famous novel <i>Fuoco</i> (1900), a picture of Venetian
splendour as gorgeous as that of Rome in <i>Piacère</i>,
but touched with the new joy in power; and the
dramas <i>Sogno d’un Mattino di Primavera</i> (1897),
<i>Gioconda</i>, and <i>Città Morta</i> (1898). In the last
named d’Annunzio’s vision of power assumes an
audacious and original form. It is here the power
of the vanished past to stretch an invisible hand
across the centuries and strike down youth and
life. The result is a tragedy that reproduces as
nearly as a modern dramatist may the horror
excited in ancient spectators by the doom of the
House of Atreus. Nothing indeed could be less
Greek than the structure and persons of the play.
Leonardo, a young archæologist, is excavating in
the ruins of Mycenæ. With him are his sister,
Beata Maria, and their friends Alessandro and
Anna his wife, a cluster of human flowers, full of
living charm and sap, transplanted into the ‘dead
city.’ But the dead city is not merely dead; it
is mysteriously fraught with the power of the
vanished past to control the present and the
future. Its mouldering ruins are the arena of a
struggle between Death and Life, in which death
triumphs and life receives the mortal blow.
Leonardo, obsessed with the <i>Oresteia</i>, is haunted
at night by visions of terrific blood-stained figures,
and has no thoughts by day but of penetrating
the secrets of their tombs. Alessandro, full of
the joy of life, seeks to detach him from these
preoccupations. ‘I hoped he would have come
with me and gathered flowers with those fingers
of his which know nothing but stones and dust,’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
and he is drawn to Beata Maria, herself the very
genius of glowing youth, ‘the one live thing,
says her friend Anna, in this place, where all is
dead and burnt ... it is incredible what force
of life is in her ... if she were not, none of us
could live here, we should all die of thirst.’
‘When Beata Maria speaks, he who hears forgets
his pain, and believes that life can still be sweet.’
She herself is devoted to the brother whose passion
seems to estrange him so far from what she loves.
She shares his Hellenic ardour, and innocently
recites Cassandra’s prophecy in the <i>Agamemnon</i>,
with Cassandra’s wreath on her golden locks, of
‘an evil, intolerable to the nearest kin, and
irreparable, preparing in this house.’ Anna,
struck with mysterious fear, stops her; but the
ominous words have been spoken, and foreshadow
a real doom. Beata Maria, the unconscious
Cassandra, will suffer Cassandra’s fate. The indestructible
virus of the dead city will poison the
glory of youth. The incestuous passion which
desolated the House of Atreus is not extinguished
in the crumbling dust of their tombs. A horrible
infection seizes Leonardo. He struggles vainly
with an impure passion for his sister. In only
one way can his love be purified, a way grievous
for him, and yet more grievous for her. She must
die; and he slays her among the tombs of the
‘dead city’ which has thus again laid upon the
living its mortal hand.</p>

<p>The conclusion outrages our feelings, and
betrays d’Annunzio’s glaring deficiency in sympathetic
power. Whatever pity we feel for Leonardo
in his miserable plight is dispelled by his cynical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
purchase of the purity of his own emotions at the
price of his innocent sister’s death. Here, as in
other cases, d’Annunzio’s fundamental want of
passion, and the strain of hard egoism which pervaded
the movements of his brilliant mind, gravely
injured his attempts in tragic poetry. Death was
doubtless the only solution; but it must be
another death—one that would have saved the
‘purity’ of Leonardo’s emotions by ending
them altogether. Leonardo, however, has the
ruthless energy of the Superman, and the innocent
life must be crushed that he may rise.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>Yet d’Annunzio’s vision of power, his appetency
of enormous and abnormal things, was now to
assume a new form. The grandiose dream of the
Superman expands into the dream of the Super-nation.
The discovery of Rome had taught him
something of the pride of citizenship, and more
than the nascent pride of nationality. But in
the last year of the century he underwent an
experience which turned this nascent emotion into
a passion, and the poet himself into a prophet and
preacher in its service, an ‘announcer’ as he was
fond of saying, of the cause and creed of <i>Italianità</i>.</p>

<p>He had as yet seen nothing of Europe beyond
the Alps. In 1900 he made an extensive tour,
but in no tourist spirit. An Italian had no need
to go abroad for beauty of nature or of art, and
d’Annunzio’s keen eyes were turned in quite
other directions—to the great Transalpine nations
with their vast resources and their high ambitions;
and he measured their several capacities for success<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
in the conflict which he, among the first, saw to
be impending. He was impressed by the threatening
growth of Germany, and by ‘the extraordinary
development of race-energy’ in England.
Everywhere the force of nationality was more
vehement than ever before. ‘All the world is
stretched like a bow, and never was the saying
of Heracleitos more significant: “The bow is
called Bios (life), and its work is death.”’</p>

<p>But where was Italy in this universal tension of
the national spirit? Where was <i>her</i> strung bow?
How was <i>she</i> preparing to hold her own with
the great progressive nations of the North?
D’Annunzio flung down these challenging questions
in his eloquent pamphlet, <i>Della coscienza
nazionale</i> (1900). To the foreign observer the
trouble with Italy did not seem to be defective
ambition. She had rather appeared to take her
new rôle as a great Power too seriously, blundering
into rash adventures abroad when she ought to
have been spreading the elements of civilization
at home. But d’Annunzio had seen the race for
empire in the North, and his call to Italy was
the call of an imperialist; a call for unity of
purpose, for concentration of national wealth and
strength in the interest of a greater Italy, mistress
of the Adriatic, if not of the Mediterranean. It
was the beginning of a new phase of d’Annunzio’s
career. He was henceforth a public man, whose
voice, the most resonant and eloquent then to be
heard in Italy, counted, as poetic voices so rarely
do, in the direction of public affairs. He entered
Parliament, a proclaimed disciple in policy of
Crispi, the Italian Bismarck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span></p>

<p>How did these enlarged ideals affect d’Annunzio’s
work in poetry? In part, as has been hinted,
disastrously. The enlarged ideals lent themselves
with perverse ease, in a mind already obsessed
with <i>sovrumanità</i>, to a mere megalomania, a rage
for bigness, only more mischievous in practice,
and nowise better as literature, because it was
conveyed in terms of navies and transmarine
dominions. He had already in his fine series of
<i>Odi Navali</i> (1893) fanned to some purpose the
naval ambitions of his country. He now sounded
a loftier note, suited to the vaster horizons of an
Italian Mediterranean. These, for instance, are
some stanzas from the opening hymn or prayer
prefixed to his colossal naval tragedy, <i>La Nave</i>
(1908):</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">O Lord, who bringest forth and dost efface</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ocean-ruling Nations, race by race,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It is this living People by Thy grace</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Who on the Sea</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall magnify Thy name, who on the Sea</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shall glorify Thy name, who on the Sea</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With myrrh and blood shall sacrifice to Thee</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">At the altar-prow.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of all Earth’s oceans make Our Sea, O Thou!</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Amen!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The fourth book of the <i>Laudi</i> is a lyric celebration
in this spirit, of the Tripoli adventure
‘beyond the sea.’ But megalomania was happily
not the whole result. The older and deeper
instincts planted or quickened in d’Annunzio by
his earlier experience—the feeling for race and for
historic continuity—coalesced with the new and
vehement passion of nationality, communicating
to it, in moments of vision, something of their
human intimacy, and undergoing in their turn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
an answering enlargement of range and scope.
If his <i>Italianità</i> was something more significant
than a resonant cry for more ships and territory,
it was because it drew warmth and insight from
the home sentiment for his Abruzzan province
deep-rooted in the poet’s heart; while the Abruzzan
province, in its turn, was seen in the larger and
grander setting of the Italian people and the
Roman race, but without the distorting nimbus of
megalomaniac dreams. This fortunate harmony
found expression chiefly in certain poems of the
years shortly before and after the beginning of
the new century, the golden period of d’Annunzio’s
production. To these years belong his two most
notable attempts to give to Italy a tragic poetry
built upon Italian history.</p>

<p>In the material for tragic poetry no country
was richer, but it had been left to the genius of
foreign dramatists to give world-wide fame to the
stories of Romeo and Juliet, Beatrice Cenci, and
Torquato Tasso. Alfieri, the greatest of Italian
tragic poets, had devoted his austere art almost
solely to classical subjects; and his <i>Don Garzia</i>
and <i>Congiura de’ Pazzi</i>, with Niccolini’s <i>Arnaldo
da Brescia</i>, Monti’s <i>Galeotto Manfredi</i>, and Manzoni’s
<i>Conte di Carmagnola</i> and <i>Adelchi</i> stood
almost alone, as remarkable Italian tragedies
on Italian themes. In the story of Francesca of
Rimini, d’Annunzio found to his hand a native
tragic subject of the first order, not yet touched
by a tragic poet of genius, Italian or other. That
it had been made his own by the supreme poet
of Italy hardly disturbed d’Annunzio, deeply as
he revered the poet whose words, in the fine phrase<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
of his Dante Ode, clothed Italy like the splendour
of day. He was not going to challenge comparison
with Dante’s marmoreal brevity. And the poet
of Pescara had some title to regard this story of
the adjacent Adriatic sea-board of Rimini and
Ravenna, as his by right. But the story itself
has also exerted its moderating control upon the
natural prodigiosity of his invention, so that in
his Francescan tragedy it is possible to recognize
a general conformity to traditional technique.</p>

<p>It is even possible that Shakespeare’s handling
of his Italian tragedy may have afforded a hint.
The ruin of Romeo and Juliet results from the
feud of the rival houses. The ruin of d’Annunzio’s
Francesca and Paolo is similarly rooted ultimately
in the feud of Guelf and Ghibelline. Her father,
a great Guelf captain, has sold her to the lord of
Ravenna, as the price of support against the
Ghibellines. But when her hand is thus plighted,
she has already seen his brother Paolo, with his
feminine beauty and luxuriant locks, pass under
her window, and the seed of their passion is sown.
Francesca has grown up ‘a flower in an iron soil,’
and love throughout is set in a frame of war. But
she would be no d’Annunzian heroine if she did
not respond to the call of life and light. When
about to leave Rimini on her marriage she replies
to the pleading of her devoted young sister who
cannot live without her, ‘I am going, sweet life,
where thou canst not come, to a deep and solitary
place, where a great fire burns without fuel.’ Fire
is d’Annunzio’s haunting symbol for terrible and
splendid things, a symbol, too, for the strange
union of cruelty and beauty in his own mind and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
art, and it does not here forecast only the Inferno
flames in which she will move with Paolo so lightly
before the wind. In the palace at Ravenna we
see her among her ladies, chafing at her dull
seclusion, while the Ghibelline siege rages without.
A Florentine merchant displays his gorgeous wares
before them, a feast of scarlet and gold. Presently
Francesca has climbed to the tower where her
husband’s brothers are on guard. Bolts and
arrows crash against the walls or through the
loophole. A cauldron of Greek fire stands ready
for use. Francesca, to the horror of the soldiers,
fires it, and breaks into wild ecstasy at the ‘deadly
beauty’ of this ‘swift and terrible life.’ A
moment later a bolt pierces the curls of Paolo.
She thinks he is wounded, and clasps his head.
In that embrace he stammers the first word of
love. ‘They have not hit me, but your hands
have touched me, and have undone the soul
within my heart!...’ <i>Francesca</i>: ‘Lost! Thou
art lost!’ Thus, again, Francesca’s fate, like
Juliet’s, is provoked by the irrelevant feud of
parties without. But presently the same irrelevant
feud thrusts the lovers apart. Paolo is sent as
General of the Guelf forces to Florence. Francesca
in his absence reads the Lancelot romance with
her ladies. But Paolo, unable to endure his
exile, posts back to Ravenna, and rushes to her
chamber. The romance of Lancelot lies open on the
lectern. The place where the reading stopped is
marked; it is where Galeotto is urging Lancelot’s
suit upon Ginevra. They bend over the book
together. The following dialogue replaces Dante’s
single pregnant line:</p>

<p>The sequel is too long drawn out, and is marred
by the duplicity of all the persons concerned.
Malatestino’s sleuth-hound cunning brings about
the husband’s vengeance, but his strategy is animated
only by ferocious hatred of the lovers, not
by any care for justice. By his contrivance the
rough soldier, who has never suspected his own
wrongs, returns prematurely from the march, and
thunders at the lovers’ chamber door: ‘Open,
Francesca!’ The wretched Paolo tries to escape
through a trapdoor, but is dragged up by the
hair to be slain. But Francesca rushes to clasp
him, and the husband’s sword pierces her.
<i>Francesca da Rimini</i>, though a brilliant drama,
with innumerable beauties of detail, misses, like
the <i>Dead City</i>, the quality of great tragedy. Of
the principal characters Francesca alone excites a
fitful sympathy, while Paolo’s effeminacy provokes
a contempt which diminishes our compassion for
the woman whose love he has won. These coward
‘heroes’ who leave their mistresses in mortal
peril, or slay their sisters, or see their brides borne
to execution in their place, seem to haunt the
egoist imagination of the poet, to the grievous
hurt of his work. Yet when all is said, <i>Francesca</i>
is one of the most arresting, though dramatically
by no means one of the best, plays produced in
Europe during the first decade of the century.</p>

<p>If the <i>Francesca</i> owed much to the stimulus
and the control of a great historic and literary
tradition, the rarer beauty of <i>La Figlia di Iorio</i>
(1904) was nourished on the old intimate passion
for his Abruzzan race and home. In language the
more moving, because in d’Annunzio so seldom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
heard, he dedicated ‘To the land of Abruzzi,
to my Mother, to my Sisters, to my Brother in
exile, to my Father in his grave, to all my Dead,
to all my People between the Mountains and the
Sea, this song of the ancient blood.’ It betokened,
indeed, no mere recurrence to the scenes and
memories of his childhood, but a recovery, through
them, of the more primitive sensibilities and
sympathies which the complexities of an ultra
modern culture had obscured or submerged. The
shepherds and peasants of this ‘pastoral tragedy’
live and move in an atmosphere fanatically tense
with the customs and beliefs of their catholicized
paganism; but no believing poet ever drew the
ritual of rustic unreason with more delicate
sympathy, or rendered its wild prayers and
incantations in more expressive and beautiful
song. For the poetry is not exotic or imposed;
like the songs of peasants in opera, it is found and
elicited. The young shepherd, Aligi, is drawn into
a kind of mystic relationship to Mila di Codra,
a witch-maiden dreaded and abhorred over the
whole countryside. But a bride has been chosen
for him by his family, and the scene opens on the
morning after their nominal bridal. Aligi’s three
sisters are seen kneeling before the old carved oak
chest, choosing her bridal robes, and vying with
each other in joyous morning carols. A band of
scarlet wool is drawn across the open door, a
crook and a distaff lean against it, and by the
doorpost hangs a waxen cross as a charm against
evil spells. Aligi looks on in dreamy distraction,
his thoughts far away. The women of the neighbouring
farms come in procession bearing gifts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
corn in baskets on their heads. An unknown
girl follows in their train. Presently angry cries
are heard in the distance. The reapers are in
pursuit of Mila, whose spells have spoilt their
harvest; they have seen her enter the house, and
now they clamour at the door for her surrender.
The frightened women tremble, but Mila has
crouched down on the sacred hearth, whence it
would be sacrilege to remove her, and Ornella,
the youngest of the sisters, who alone secretly
pities Mila, draws the bolts. The storm of menace
grows louder, till Aligi, roused from his dreamy
absorption by the taunts of the women, raises
his hand to strike the suppliant on the hearth.
Immediately the horror of his sacrilege seizes him,
he implores her pardon on his knees, and thrusts
his guilty hand into the flame. Then he hangs
the cross above the door and releases the bolts.
The reapers rush in, but seeing the cross, draw
back in dismay, baring their heads. Aligi has
saved his ‘sister in Christ;’ but his guilt is not
effaced.</p>

<p>In the second Act, Aligi and Mila are living
together, as brother and sister, in a mountain
cavern. He would fain go with his flocks to
Rome to seek dissolution of his marriage; but she
knows that happiness is not for her, and she will
not hurt him with her passionate love. But in
his home they know only that the witch-maiden
has decoyed the son away from his mother and
his virgin bride; Ornella, the compassionate sister,
is thrust out of doors, and now the father, who
had returned home only after the reapers had
gone, arrives at the mountain cavern in Aligi’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
absence, and peremptorily summons Mila. She
holds him defiantly at bay. He is about to seize
her, when Aligi appears on the threshold. In the
great scene which follows the Roman authority
of the Abruzzan father over the son overpowers
for the moment even the lover’s devotion. Not
softened by Aligi’s humble submission, Làzaro
binds him, flogs him savagely, and turns upon
Mila, now wholly in his power. At the moment
when he has seized her Aligi breaks free, rushes
upon his father, and kills him. The third act
opens with the mourning for Làzaro, in long-drawn
lyric dirges. Then harsher and fiercer notes are
heard, and Aligi, deeply penitent, appears black-robed
and bound, borne by the angry mob to bid
farewell to his mother before being led to the parricide’s
death. ‘To call you mother is no more
permitted me, for my mouth is of hell, the mouth
that sucked your milk, and learnt from you holy
prayers in the fear of God. Why have I harmed
you so sorely? I would fain say, but I will be
silent. O most helpless of all women who have
suckled a son, who have sung him to sleep in the
cradle and at the breast, O do not lift this black
veil to see the face of the trembling sinner....’
The crowd tries to comfort her in its rough way,
and the mother gives her son the bowl of drugged
wine. Suddenly, confused cries are heard in the
rear, and Mila breaks her way impetuously through
the throng. ‘Mother, sisters, bride of Aligi, just
people, justice of God, I am Mila di Codra. I
am guilty. Give me hearing!’ They call for
silence, and Mila declares that Aligi is innocent,
and she the murderer. Aligi protests: ‘Before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
God thou liest.’ But the crowd eagerly turns its
fury upon the dreaded sorceress who owns her
guilt, and the cry goes up: ‘To the flames! To
the flames!’ Aligi protests again, but with
growing faintness, as the deadening potion masters
and confuses his brain; till at length, when the
bonds have been transferred from his limbs to
Mila’s, he lifts up his hands to curse her. At
this felon stroke her spirit breaks down. With a
piercing shriek she cries: ‘Aligi, Aligi, not thou,
thou canst not, thou must not!’ She is hurried
away to the stake, only Ornella crying aloud:
‘Mila, Mila, Sister in Jesus, Paradise is for thee,’
while Mila herself, now full of the d’Annunzian
exultation in glorious ruin, goes to her death
crying: ‘Beautiful Flame, Beautiful Flame!’</p>

<p>A brief résumé such as this inevitably brings
into undue emphasis the melodramatic elements of
the plot. Yet it is the most human and natural,
as it is the most beautiful, of d’Annunzio’s dramas.
For the strangest things that happen in it are no
mere projections of the poet’s inspired ferocity or
eroticism, as so often elsewhere, but are grounded
in the real psychology of a primitive countryside.
We see its fear, love, hatred, now mysteriously
mastered by superstitious awe, now breaking rebelliously
from its control, now wrought by its
mystic power to else inexplicable excesses.</p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>But even the finest dramatic work of d’Annunzio
makes clear that his genius is fundamentally
lyrical. The greatest moments of <i>La Figlia di<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
Iorio</i> and <i>Francesca</i> are uttered in a vein which
thrills and sings; while, on the other hand, these
moments are often reached by summary short
cuts, not by the logical evolution of great drama.
And it is fortunate that while he continued to be
allured by drama—giving in particular a very
individual rendering of the tragedy of Phædra
(1909)—d’Annunzio’s most serious and ambitious
poetry took the form of a festival of sustained
song, the <i>Laudi</i> (1903 onwards). We have already
quoted from the picture of his childhood drawn
retrospectively, in the opening book, by the poet of
forty. But these passages, though not at all merely
episodic, hardly disclose the deeper sources of
inspiration in this series of lyric cycles. ‘Praises,’
he calls them, ‘Praises of the Sky, of the Sea,
of the Earth, of its Heroes.’ The glory of earth,
and sea, and sky had drawn more majestic praise
from the poet of the 123rd Psalm, though in his
naïve Hebrew way he ‘praised’ only their
Maker, not these ‘wonderful works’ themselves.
D’Annunzio’s ‘praise’ expresses simply the ravishment
of acute sensibilities in the presence of the
loveliness and sublimity of Nature and the heroism
of man, an emotion Greek rather than Hebraic.
Our poet is perhaps the least Hebraic of all modern
poets of genius; and if his barbaric violence
alienates him almost as completely from the
Hellenic temper, he is yet akin to it by his inexhaustible
joy in beauty. And in these years of
the <i>Laudi</i> Hellas had become more than ever the
determining focus about which his artistic dreams
revolved, the magnet to whose lure even the
barbarian in him succumbs. The first book, called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
<i>Maia</i>, after the mother of Hermes, describes the
poet’s spiritual journey to the shrine of that god
of energy and enterprise, whose Praxitelean image,
the most magnificent expression of radiant virility
ever fashioned by the chisel, had not long before
been unearthed at Olympia. It is a journey of
discovery, and d’Annunzio invokes for it the
symbolism of the last voyage of the Dantesque
Ulysses to seek the experience that lay ‘beyond
the sunset.’ D’Annunzio turns his prow east,
not west, but he, too, is daring peril in the quest
of the unknown. A splendid Proem in <i>terza
rima</i>, ‘To the Pleiads and the Fates,’ takes us
to a rocky promontory by the Atlantic shore,
where, on a flaming pyre, the helm of the wrecked
ship of Ulysses is being consumed—the fiery consummation
which crowns most of d’Annunzio’s
heroic careers. The modern venturer, too, must
disdain safety, not like Galileo turning back into
the secure haven, but fronting the pathless sea of
fate with no anchor but his own valour. The
sequel does not, it is true, accord completely with
this Ulyssean vision. Symbolic imagery is interwoven,
in this ‘spiritual journey,’ to the ruin
of poetic coherence, with scenes from an actual
voyage to Greece, leaves from a tourist’s notebook,
incidents of steamer-life, games and talk on board,
sketches of fellow-passengers, the squalor and vice
of Patras. Presently the ship reaches Elis, and
then, as we enter the ruins of Olympia, the great
past, human and divine, rises up before us.
Pericles, Alcibiades, Themistocles obliterate the
tourist memories, and the poet holds high colloquy
with Zeus, and offers up a prayer, nine hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
lines long, to Hermes—a lurid picture of the future
of humanity, as d’Annunzio imagined it, wrought
by the genius of Energy and Enterprise, Invention
and Will; a future dominated by men of rocky
jaw, who chew care like a laurel leaf, precipitate
themselves on life, and impregnate it relentlessly
with their purposes,—a significant image, for the
d’Annunzian Hermes is fused with Eros (v. 2904).
Eros was, indeed, indispensable, it might well be
thought, to a quite satisfying d’Annunzian divinity.
Yet in the fine colloquy with Zeus, which precedes,
he touches a deeper note, rare with him, of desperate
and baffled struggle with his own ‘vast sensuality.’
He begs Zeus for a sign. ‘I am at war with
many monsters, but the direst are those, ah
me! which rise within me from the depths of
my lusts.’ ‘Thou wilt conquer them,’ replies
Zeus, ‘only if thou canst transform them into
divine children.’</p>

<p>The monsters, nevertheless, continued to haunt
his later art. But happier moods were interposed,
when he found relief from their urgency
in poetic communing with the passionless calm
of Nature and of the dead things that cannot
die.</p>

<p>Such moods in the second and third books of
the <i>Laudi</i>, <i>Elettra</i> and <i>Alcione</i>, both mainly written
before the <i>Maia</i>. The <i>Alcione</i>, in particular, is
the record of a true ‘halcyon’ season—of hours
or moments—in the poet’s stormy course. It
opens, indeed, with a savage denunciation—in
perfectly handled <i>terza rima</i>—of the demons, within
and without, that he has striven with. But now
for a while he calls a truce:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span></p>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">Air and light and water do indeed play a large
and significant part in this benign experience,
and in the poetry which renders it. Water, we
know, had peculiar allurements for his imagination;
but now the obsession of fleets and arsenals
is overcome, and he looks out over the wide levels
of the Arno mouth, where fishing boats with their
hanging nets are seen, transfigured in the effulgence
of the west, like cups or lilies of flame upon the
water; or ‘on a June evening after rain,’ when
‘the gracious sky, tenderly gazing at her image
in the earth she has refreshed, laughs out from a
thousand mirrors.’ The solidity of the material
world seems to remain only in its most delicate
and attenuated forms—the crescent moon ‘slender
as the eyebrow of a girl,’ the lean boughs and
tapering leaves of the olive, the seashore sand,
not ‘ribbed’ as Wordsworth put it, but delicately
traced like the palate or the finger-tip. The poet
is visibly striving through these frail and delicate
things to escape his obsession into a realm of
spirit he divines, but cannot reach:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">A slender wreath suffices, with few leaves,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Lest it with weight or any shadow burden</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The gracious thoughts of dawn!</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">This is the language of no sensualist, but of a
mystic. And d’Annunzio in these poems again
and again approaches the poetic mysticism of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
Wordsworth, and of Shelley and Dante. As he
watches the dewy loveliness of evening, the earth
seems to dissolve in the ‘infinite smile,’ which
for Shelley ‘kindled the universe’;<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and for
the Italian it is the smile of Beatrice. In the
child, who hardly exists for him before, the poet
of pitiless virility now sees not only ‘the father of
the man,’ but the soul implicitly aware of the
Truth we only guess at:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">The immense plenitude of life</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>There are hints, perhaps reminiscences, of
Wordsworth here; but d’Annunzio’s more obvious
affinity is doubtless with Shelley, whose Roman
grave he saluted in an ode of lofty eulogy and
sculptured grace.</p>

<p>The lyric eloquence of <i>Alcione</i> undoubtedly
recalls the rush of Shelley’s music and the æthereal
liquidity of his style. Yet they touch across a
gulf of profound disparity. D’Annunzio, for all
his preoccupation with air and light and water,
never, either as man or as artist, escapes the
earth. The hard stuff of his egoism is never really
transmuted in the flame of love; nor does the
clear and delicate precision of his style ever
really dissolve in radiant suffusion. D’Annunzio’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
nature-world, like Shelley’s, is peopled with imagined
shapes, in which the myths of old Greece
are created anew. But here too their divergence
asserts itself. Shelley’s Prometheus is not really
earth-born, and his Asia is the hardly embodied
symbol of the ideal passion of his own soul. While
d’Annunzio’s Triton and Dryad are recognizably
akin to the sea or woodland life they spring from,
hued like the salt deep, and full of the sap of
earth. D’Annunzio is the greater artist, Shelley
the finer and the rarer soul.</p>

<p>But these gracious idylls were, as has been
hinted, an episode. Nature could not replace
man; beyond ‘earth’ and ‘sea’ and ‘sky,’
the ‘heroes,’ and especially the heroes and
heroic memories of Italy, called for his ‘praise.’
Here, he felt, was the home of his spirit. The
gracious valley of Arno might be</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">A cradle of flowers and dreams and peace;</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But the cradle of my soul</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is the crashing chariot’s furrow</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">In the stone of the Appian Way.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The <i>Elettra</i>, the second book of the <i>Laudi</i>, is
mainly devoted to the memories of these vanished
glories. The resonant herald of the Third Italy
wanders, for instance, among the ‘Cities of Silence’—decayed,
half grass-grown capitals of vanished
dukes and extinct republics—Ferrara, Pisa, Pistoja;
oldest and grandest of all, Ravenna, the ‘deep
ship’s hull, heavy with the iron weight of empire,
driven by shipwreck on the utmost bounds of the
world.’<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Of the sequence of lyrics on the great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
enterprise of Garibaldi’s ‘Thousand,’ <i>La Notte di
Caprera</i>, it is enough to say that it is worthy of
being put beside Carducci’s Ode. After a quarter
of a century Garibaldi’s glory was no whit dimmed.
On the contrary, Italians who knew how many
gross blots defiled the Italy he had helped to
win, saw Garibaldi as a figure of ideal splendour
and purity on the further side of a foul morass.
The bitter disillusion of such minds is powerfully
painted in the moving piece: ‘To One of the
Thousand.’ An old Garibaldian sailor brings his
broken anchor-cable to the ship cordwainer to
be mended. He looks on, sombre, dejected,
silent, but thinking what he does not say; and
his thoughts are like this:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The anchor-sheet is broken: let it be.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No hope of mending. Give it up, go home!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Turn into scourges, cordsman, and halter-nooses</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Thy bitter twine.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Vilely supine lies the Third Italy,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A harlot-people put to basest uses,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And in her holy oak-grove’s shadow, Rome</div>
    <div class="verse indent4">Pastures her swine.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But Rome, the eternal City, could only obscure
her destiny, not efface it; disillusion founded on
her moments of self-oblivion was itself the vainest
of illusions. That is the faith of the new Italian
Renascence, and d’Annunzio, the fiercest chastiser
of her oblivious fatuities, attains his loftiest note
of ‘praise’ in the Ode which prophetically arrays
Rome in glory as the future centre of the embodied
Power of Man.</p>

<p>It is based on the legend, told by Ovid,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
ship of the Great Mother, stranded in the Tiber
mud, and drawn to shore by the Vestal Virgin
Claudia Quinta. The opening stanzas tell the
story—the dearth in the city, the Sibylline oracle’s
counsel to bring the image of the Mater Magna,
the arrival of her ship in the river, the stranding
in the mud, the vain efforts of the entire city to
extricate it, until a Vestal Virgin, without an
effort, draws it to bank. Then the poet interprets
the symbolic legend:</p>

<p>On this note, the climax of his boundless national
faith, we will leave d’Annunzio. We are apt to
think that the tide of humanity has ebbed decisively
away from the city of the seven hills, and that
wherever its sundered streams may be destined
finally to flow together in unison, the Roman
Forum, where the roads of all the world once met,
will not be that spot. Yet a city which can
generate magnificent, even if illusory, dreams is
assured of a real potency in human affairs not to
be challenged in its kind by far greater and wealthier
cities which the Londoner, or the New Yorker, or
even the Parisian, would never think of addressing
in these lyrical terms.</p>

<p>Few men so splendidly endowed as d’Annunzio
have given the world so much occasion for resentment
and for ridicule. His greatest gifts lend
themselves with fatal ease to abuse; his ‘vast
sensuality’ and his iron nerve sometimes co-operate
and enforce one another in abortions of erotics<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
and ferocity. But the same gifts, in other phases,
become the creative and controlling elements of
his sumptuous style. His boundless wealth of
sensuous images provides the gorgeous texture of
its ever changing woof. But its luxury is controlled
by tenacious purpose; the sentences,
however richly arrayed, move with complete
lucidity of aim to their goal; the surface is pictorial,
but the structure is marble. Thus this
Faun of genius, as he seems under one aspect,
compounded with the Quixotic adventurer, as he
seems under another, meet in one of the supreme
literary artists of the Latin race; a creator of
beauty which, however Latin in origin and cast,
has the quality that strikes home across the
boundaries of race, and has already gone far to
make its author not merely the protagonist of
the Latin renascence, but a European classic.</p>

<p><b>IS THERE A POETIC VIEW

OF THE WORLD?</b></p>
</div>

<p class="noin"><span class="dropcapb"><span class="dropfix">‘</span>V</span>IEW of the World’ is a clumsy phrase for
an idea which itself has for most of us
an unattractive flavour of pedantry. This latter
impression is hardly removed by a knowledge of
the part which, under the neater and more expressive,
term <i>Weltanschauung</i>, it has played in German
literary study. <i>Weltanschauung</i> is the indispensable
final chapter without which no German biography,
the confidential disclosure without which
no German friendship, is complete. A <i>Weltanschauung</i>
or ‘World-view,’ in its full scope, comprehends
ideas about life of quite distinct categories;
it touches metaphysics and science, ethics
and æsthetics; it offers an answer to Faust’s
question ‘what it is that at bottom holds the
world together,’ but also to the practical questions,
what is the end of action and how we ought
to act.</p>

<p>Historically, we know, the answers to these
questions occur, in great part, as successive steps
in continuous or closely-connected processes of
thought. But between these continuous processes
yawn gulfs which no argument can bridge. From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
Bacon through Hobbes to Locke we can trace
something like a connected development. But
between Hobbes and his contemporary Boehme
there is a cleavage due not to bad reasoning on
either side, but to a radical difference in the kind
of experience from which the reasoning in the
two cases set out. And the history of belief indicates
that there are at least two types of elemental
experience which thus generate ideas about the
world, and to which two great classes of World-view
in essence correspond. These may be distinguished
as the <i>religious</i> and the <i>philosophical</i>.
In the first, thought is dominated by the consciousness
of a power or powers distinct from
man, controlling his fate, protecting his country
or his tribe, determining his moral code, his scheme
of values, and his expectations after death. From
the crudest fetishism and animism to the loftiest
theism, a living relation to such a Power is the root
fact from which the religious World-view takes its
origin and derives its character.</p>

<p>On the other hand, we find a vast and complex
body of conceptions of the world which do not
originate in intercourse with a divine Power, or
in the fear or hope which such a power may inspire,
but in the effort to give a finally and universally
valid account of experience.</p>

<p>Naturally, neither these nor any other type of
World-view, if such there be, are mutually exclusive
in substance and content. Religion may reach the
conclusions of philosophy, and philosophy those
of religion, each by a path strictly its own. Historically,
the two attitudes to life have intimately
interacted; and if the religious type has on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
whole shown less power of resistance to the penetration
of ideas of the opposed type, on the other
hand modern philosophy, in particular, has often
built upon, and not seldom with, ideas first begotten
not by speculative curiosity, but by the rapture
or the agony of God-intoxicated or demon-haunted
souls. The eternal war of Ormuzd and Ahriman
still echoes in the Hebraic intensity of our distinction
between good and evil; and the visionary
ecstasies of the mystics were of account in the
evolution of philosophic pantheism. And, similarly,
the edifices of theology have borrowed
fortifying buttresses or indispensable pillars from
ideas evolved by scientific reason or a purely
secular interpretation of good. Aristotle, applied
and interpreted by Aquinas, became one of the
masters, not only of those who know, but of those
who believe. Nevertheless, the two types have,
on a comprehensive survey, stood distinctly apart;
and their ramifications appear to dominate between
them the entire field of belief and speculative
thought.</p>

<p>Is it possible, nevertheless, to distinguish a third
type of ‘World-view’ analogous to these? In
other words, is there any third kind of experience,
distinct from that of either religion or philosophy,
yet involving an apprehension of reality comparable
in originality, and possibly in importance,
with theirs? The present essay is based upon
the view that such an experience is given in and by
poetry.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span></p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>For the specific experience which comes to a
poet through poetry, however it may be interwoven
with religious or philosophic ideas, has a radically
different psychological origin and character. It is
equally intense and absorbing, but it is not determined
by conscious relation to an outer power,
and it seeks to express rather than to explain.
It is neither transfigured fear or hope, nor yet a
logical process. In the making of a poem there
may be even a conscious detachment from actuality,
and the poet may float free in a dream world,
apparently without thought of the world which
he inhabits. The poetic may well be thought to
differ from the religious or the philosophic types
of experience less in inducing any specific way of
contemplating reality than in liberating us from
the necessity or desire to contemplate it at all.</p>

<p>Yet it is certain that the poet’s detachment,
even in his most ethereal dream-flights, from
reality, is only apparent. In all the spontaneous
and seemingly arbitrary movement of his mind
among its crowding ideal shapes, reality through
his stored-up experience is at work, quietly weaving
a thousand subtle filiations between the poem
and the life of men at large. <i>Othello</i> is much
farther from ‘actuality’ than the poor novel on
which its story was based; but it is penetrated with
the vision of life, of which Cinthio’s tale caught so
feeble and fugitive a glimpse. What distinguishes
poetic from religious or philosophic apprehension
is not that it turns away from reality, but that it
lies open to and in eager watch for reality at doors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
and windows which with them are barred or
blind. The poet’s soul resides, so to speak, in his
senses, in his emotions, in his imagination, as well
as in his conscious intelligence; and we may provisionally
describe poetic apprehension as an intense
state of consciousness in which all these are
vitally concerned. In so far as a particular outlook
upon the world is founded upon a particular type
of experience, a poet’s World-view will be radically
affected by his senses, emotions, imagination. The
flower which Wordsworth contemplated on the
bank or by the lake, and that other which Tennyson
with his more curious scrutiny plucked from the
crannied wall, could stir these poets’ intellect and
heart to the depths; and their apprehension, as
poets, of God and man, of Nature, of Duty, would
have been different without it.</p>

<p>But in any case, it will be said, even if we grant
that poetic experience tends to induce some way of
regarding reality, it cannot possibly induce any
constant or definable way, if elements of mind so
infinitely diverse, so individual, as emotion and
imagination, are vitally concerned in the process.
That energizing of mind released from the control
of actuality, which we call imagination, that free
following out of trains of suggestion called up by
emotion, takes the colour, at every step, of the
individual make of the poet’s nature, and the
individual cast of his experience. In so far as a
World-view is strictly poetic in origin, the conclusion
might seem hard to resist that there may
be as many poetic World-views as there are poets.
And it is true that the individual quality of the
poet will always cleave to whatever is strictly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
poetic in his thinking. But even so, it may be
possible to determine typical directions in which
poetic apprehension tends to engender or to sway
belief, and to modify ideas imbibed in education
or accepted on authority.</p>

<p>Thus, it may be provisionally laid down that a
view of the World reached through poetic experience
will tend to accentuate those aspects of Man and
Nature, and those ways of regarding them, which
offer most scope, analogy, or sanction, to this
type of experience. Where the senses play a vital
part, and are yet vitally implicated with passion
and ideas, there will be little disposition to doctrines
which either brand the senses as evil or illusory,
or erect them into a sufficing faith. The logical
intellect, its processes and conclusions, will receive
a respectful but distant salute, while the irrational
elements of life are accepted as its needful ingredients
or even as a supreme source of its worth.
Love, which tramples on reason, and, in the great
words of à Kempis, warmly glows like a flame
beyond all measure, may be called in some sense
the natural religion of the poet. The mysterious
love of man and woman, in particular, irrelevant
to most of the problems of philosophy, and regarded
by religion chiefly as a dangerous disturbing force,
is one of the perennial springs of poetry, and one
of the shaping analogies of poetic thought. And
the same impassioned insight which gives significance
to this love exalts also all those other energies
of the soul which carry men out of and beyond
themselves. Poetry is naturally heroic; it has
presided over the cult of the hero, as religion and
philosophy over those of the saint and the sage;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
it has rewarded him with enchanting secular
Paradises, Elysian fields, Isles of the Blest, and
Temples of Fame. Poetry is disposed to magnify
human nature; the transition from Aeschylus,
who painted men greater than they were, to
Euripides, who drew them after life, is also a decline
in the intrinsic temper of poetry, if in that alone.
And because of its bent to think greatly of man,
it makes for the assertion, in the great sense, of
<i>freedom</i>—of man’s freedom to be himself. Neither
the shibboleths of political freedom nor those of
free thought have always, it is true, found response
among poets. Their part has rather been to keep
alive in mankind the temper which treats outward
obstacles not as the soul’s constraints, but as its
opportunities; the faith that iron bars do not
make a cage, and that you may be bounded in a
nutshell, and yet not only count yourself, but be,
a king of infinite space.</p>

<p>In the interpretation of Nature, poetic experience
works creatively or selectively on similar lines.
To those wonderful deposits of the imagination of
the past, the myths of extinct faiths, from which
theology and philosophy have long withdrawn
their sanction, or on which they have laid their
taboo, the poets have habitually been very tender.
And when they felt as poets, the image drawn
from a myth has never had merely decorative
value, or served merely as a ‘poetic synonym’ for
the exact term. It expressed something in the
poet’s vision not otherwise to be put into words.
If the glorious anthropomorphism of Olympus and
Asgard has faded for ever, the mystery of life
everywhere pulsing through Nature, and perpetually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
reborn in ‘Man and beast and earth and air and
sea,’ cries to the poet with a voice which will not
be put by; and the symbols by which he seeks
to convey his sense of it, if they read personality
too definitely into the play of that elusive mystery,
yet capture something in it which escapes the
reasoned formulas of science.</p>

<p>Hence many great philosophic ideas about the
universe which, without ascribing life or mind to
it, might seem projected from our inner, rather
than gathered from our outer, experience, have
powerfully appealed to poets. The antithesis of
the One and the Many, which fascinated and
fertilized every phase of Greek thought, had one
of its roots in the acute Greek feeling for continuity
through change, which is equally manifest in the
Parthenon and in the Pindaric Ode, and to a less
degree in all art and poetry wherever the sense
of rhythm is present at all. ‘When we feel the
poetic thrill,’ says Santayana, ‘is it not that we
find sweep in the concise, and depth in the clear?’
That felicitously expresses the genius of Hellenic
art in particular; but it also marks off the specifically
poetic apprehension of Oneness as a ‘something
deeply interfused’ in and through the living multiplicity
of the world, alike from the mystic vision
of a One whose splendour dissolves the reality of
things, and from the vision of Peter Bell, for whom
nothing but ‘things’ exists. Yet even this pregnant
Oneness has commonly gathered, in the poetic
conception of the universe, the higher and richer
attribute of soul-life. It has become a living and
working Nature vitally implicated in every organ
and filament, or Mind diffused through every<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
limb, or Love, or Beauty, or Power, woven through
the woof of it, or the splendour of God irradiating
it through and through.</p>

<p class="p2">When we turn, as is proposed in what follows,
from these general considerations to watch the
actual operation of poetic apprehension in concrete
examples, we naturally encounter some serious
difficulties. Poetic apprehension may be as distinct
and definable as we will, but it can rarely
be caught acting <i>in vacuo</i>. Poets are men; they
are usually citizens; they are often penetrated
with some form of religious or philosophical faith.
It is inevitable, in such cases, that their strictly
poetic experience should be coloured or even
overridden by ideas proper to their possibly more
habitual or more deeply established persuasions.
In poets like Goethe and Shelley, deeply concerned
with the issues of life outside poetry, philosophic
and poetic impulses and data may well seem
inextricably mingled. Even Blake and Whitman,
who perhaps come nearer than any other moderns
to shaping out a poetic World-view for themselves,
evidently worked, as poets, under a deep
bias of revolutionary dogma, which made them
unjust to some aspects of poetry itself. And with
poet-exponents of great theological or philosophical
systems, like Lucretius or Dante, it may well
appear idle to seek to catch the moment when the
runnel of poetry carved out a watercourse of its
own, instead of falling into and moving along
with the great tide of Epicurean or Catholic thought.
Yet we attach some meaning to our words when
we distinguish periods in which the poetic element<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
in a poet’s nature was more potent than at others.
When we say, for instance, that in Shelley the
poetic apprehension after 1812 worked itself progressively
free from an alien philosophy; or that
in Wordsworth, from about the same date, it
became progressively overlaid by a theology almost
equally alien; or that in Dante’s <i>Convito</i>, the poet
of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>, who will finally recover dominance
in the <i>Commedia</i>, has yielded much ground
to the scholastic thinker. Distinctions so clearly
felt and sharply drawn cannot be groundless.
What is here proposed is to examine whether any
typical character or direction can be discovered
in the modifications which the data of religious or
philosophical beliefs and ideals have undergone
in certain commanding poet natures. In that
case we might possess some of the material for
answering the question I have been bold enough
to suggest in the title of this paper.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>I begin with examples in which these data are
derived from <i>religion</i>; and, in the first place, from
religion still untouched by philosophic reflection.
Without rashly assuming the solution of unsolved
or insoluble problems, one may venture to assert
that the Homeric epics owe their present form neither
to purely religious awe nor merely to conscious and
deliberate artistry, but to a poetic apprehension
of the world operating upon the data of the savage
cults and rituals, the animism, totemism, and
magic, which anthropology is gradually deciphering
under the palimpsest of their obliterating splendour.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
With some aspects of the process we are not here
concerned. If ‘Homer,’ as many modern scholars
suppose, disliked human sacrifice and similar barbarities,
and tempered or effaced the record of them,
he reflects the growing efficacy of civilized, but
not necessarily of poetic, ideas. It is otherwise
with the transformation, whatever its precise
nature and history, which put the defined character
and rich personal accent of the Homeric
Olympus in place of the psychological fluidity and
incoherence of primitive religion. For the childhood
of poetry the change possibly involved a loss.
A world where there are no barriers, or none which
magic cannot dissolve, where gods and men and
beasts pass over into one another without resistance
or demur, where everything can be done and
had if the right formula be pronounced and the
due charm applied—such a world is the home and
habitat of the fairy tale; but its facile instability
must be overcome before a mature poetry, no less
certainly than before a mature science, can arise.
The Homeric outlook upon the world had as a
religion grave flaws, which merited the strictures of
later moralists; but it had also, as a religion,
magnificent qualities to which they rarely did
justice. His deathless figures permanently raised
the status of man and the ideals of human achievement;
and every line of the poetry is instinct
with an assurance of the glory of the world and the
goodness of life, and the nobility of heroic emprise,
and of reverence and of pity, which justly made
his book the Bible of later Greece.</p>

<p>Yet it is plain that even Homer reflects or finds
reflection in but a limited tract of the Greek mind;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
that there were many deeper, as well as darker,
currents in the Greek way of apprehending the
world, of which that radiant mirror shows no
trace. Humanity had triumphed over the superhuman
as well as over the subhuman, clarity over
mystery as well as over confusion. The Ionian
thinkers of the sixth century swept away the
fables of Olympus, fastened on the problem of
substance, and proclaimed the sublime discovery
that the All is One. The Orphic cults and the
Thracian orgies of Dionysus betrayed by the widespread
and intimate hold which they won in Greek
life, refined and humanized as they doubtless were,
that religion in Greece too included the riot of
intoxicated rapture as well as clear-eyed piety;
the Bacchic frenzy, which carries men beyond themselves,
as well as temperate self-reverence and
self-control. Both these new elements enriched
and uplifted, if at some points they also impoverished
and degraded, Greek mentality and the
Greek apprehension of the world, religious, philosophic,
and poetic alike. The philosophic apprehension
of unity reacted on religion, and the two
strains coalesced in the sublime theism of Cleanthes’
hymn. The Dionysiac rapture reacted on philosophy—without
it should we have had the great
doctrine proclaimed in the <i>Phædrus</i>, of the divine
vision won through madness and love? And both
reacted upon poetry—above all on tragedy, with
its stringent ideal of unity, maintained and manifested
through all the phases and moods of conflict,
and the alliance, disclosed in its very structure,
of Apolline clarity and order with the lyric exaltation
of Dionysus. But the matter of tragedy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
shows yet more evidently the larger and deeper
World-view which poetry has now won. In passing
from Homer to Aeschylus we enter an atmosphere
in which the gods are hardly ever visible, but
which is laden and tense with the sense of divine
things. His persons, it was said, are more than
human; certainly his gods are sometimes—like the
Zeus of the <i>Prometheus</i>—less than divine. But the
Aeschylean universe has outgrown Olympus without
having dispossessed it. A soul of immense
reach and depth, apprehending life from many
sides, but always with a sense of vast issues and
inexhaustible import, here interprets the old stories
of man’s relations with the gods, and leaves us with
a new vision of the possibilities and responsibility
of man. His tragic conflicts call incommensurate
forces into play, and their apparent solution leaves
yet larger problems unsolved. The story of Prometheus
ended with his reconciliation to Zeus;
and this doubtless expressed the poet’s deliberate
intention and design. The modern world has
remembered Prometheus, not for his final surrender
or appeasement, but as the assertor and embodiment
of something in man which stands over
against the gods he recognizes, and not only endures
unflinchingly all that their utmost anger can
inflict, but arraigns them himself before a law of
Justice higher than their own. Æschylus, we
know, was a devoutly religious man, and never
dreamed of surrendering his reverence for the
divine because of the crimes of the gods. Possibly,
as Wilamowitz has suggested, he believed that
divinity itself had passed through a youth ‘full
of foolish noise’ to become with ripening years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
a righteous God and Father, worthy at length of
universal reverence. Reverence for such an erring
divinity is hardly distinguishable from forgiveness;
in any case it foreshadows, if it does not announce,
the clear recognition of human responsibility. And
that recognition is already dominant in the mature
work of Æschylus. The traditional superstitions
which still entangled the Greek mind—the doctrine
of an irresistible fate, or of a divine jealousy
attending human greatness—dissolve under the
scrutiny of his terrible insight. Man is free even
in his crimes, and the greater because he is free.
Clytaemnestra chooses and wills as freely as Lady
Macbeth; she is as little the helpless victim of the
curse of Atreus as the other of the Witches’ spell.
It needed a great poet thus to embrace in his
vision of life things incompatible to common
sense. ‘Whether Æschylus is greater,’ declares
the penetrating interpreter to whom I have referred,
‘when he uplifts our hearts by the full tones of
surrender to the divine, or when he thrills us with
the terrible acts and sufferings of human freewill,
every one must decide for himself from his own
experience; but let no one say that he understands
the poet until he has known them both.’<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> The
poet’s eye, ‘glancing from heaven to earth, from
earth to heaven,’ overcomes the antinomies of
theological dogma; and herein lies one of the
most signal services which poetic apprehension
has rendered to thought, and not least to religion.</p>

<p class="p2">To pass from Æschylus to Dante is to watch
operations of poetic intelligence in which only the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
environment, the material, and the instruments
of expression are profoundly changed. The words
just quoted of the Greek might apply without the
alteration of a syllable to the Florentine; and if
ever poet saw earth and heaven at once it was he.
But the theological World-view which he found
was more authoritatively established, more intellectual
in its philosophical substance, and more
rich and beautiful in its human appeal. The
fresh fountain of religious feeling, still abundantly
flowing, was fortified and entrenched within a
vast structure of elaborated dogma, for which
councils and saints had supplied the architects and
the masons, and ancient philosophy the stones.
Within this imposing edifice, nevertheless, Dante,
with complete conviction, found and made his
home. No one now questions the absoluteness of
Dante’s Catholic faith, and we should seek in vain
for any rebellious upsurging of the poet in him
against the starkest of scholastic abstractions.
On the contrary, his wonderful gift of style continually
finds the material for poetry in the most
seemingly arid regions. Sometimes the result is
merely an astonishing <i>tour de force</i>; but often we
become aware that Dante has not only invented
but discovered, and that many a dogma which
has the air of being the mere husk of religion is
in reality the imperfect, stammering utterance
through which religious passion sought to make
itself articulate. Dante, in short, makes us feel
in these constructions of the intellect the language
of the soul.</p>

<p>To do this needed something more than devout
belief. It needed the imaginative intuition of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
poet. The poetry of Dante was distinguished
from that of his older contemporaries above all
by being just this intense soul-vision put into
words. ‘I simply write down what Love within
dictates.’<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Psychological veracity never fails him.
Allegory, in so many hands a tissue of personified
abstractions, becomes, in his, a living image of
humanity. Symbolic meanings and applications
interweave and encircle it, but the core is real.
His vision is only on the surface a description—necessarily
speculative—of the fortunes of souls
after death; its substance, as he tells us, is ‘man
of his freewill choosing good or evil here.’ The
human denizens of his hell and purgatory and
paradise have undergone no inner change; they
are the men he had known, in their spiritual habits
as they lived; and their fate, when Dante is thinking
most as a poet and least as a theologian, is a continuation
of their crucial actions. That Paolo and
Francesca are immersed in unquenchable flames
satisfies the theological idea of retribution; Dante
inflicts on them the more searching penalty of being
for ever locked in the embrace of their illicit love.
And how often, when he thinks he is devoutly
following out to the last consequence the Church’s
dogma of eternal punishment, he is unconsciously
testifying to the poet’s sublime faith in the soul
of man as stronger than death and hell. ‘Who
is he,’ asks Dante, looking upon Capaneo (<i>Inf.</i>
xiv. 46), ‘who seems not to heed the flame, but
lies fiercely unsubdued by the fiery vein?’ Or
the yet greater picture of Farinata (<i>Inf.</i> x. 85),
defiantly erect where the rest grovel in agony,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
‘as if he held hell in great disdain.’ Even the
criminals whom the poet most abhors, and thrusts
into the very depths of the abyss, even the traitors
guilty of the death of Cæsar or of Christ, he allows
still to show greatness of soul; Brutus, champed
to a bloody foam in the jaws of Lucifer, is still the
Stoic philosopher, and though he writhes in agony,
utters not a word (<i>Inf.</i> xxxiv. 66). And how
wonderfully in the great Ulysses scene (<i>Inf.</i> xxvi)
the poet takes the pen out of the hand of the
theologian, and, forgetting the ‘fraud’ for which
the captor of Troy is doing penance in hell, compels
us to listen entranced to his tale of that last voyage,
beyond the sunset, of the old wanderer, still insatiable
of experience, who had kindled his shrinking
comrades by bidding them ‘Consider of what seed
ye are sprung; ye were not made to live like the
brute beasts, but to follow after virtue and knowledge.’
Strange words to issue from the quenchless
flames of hell! But Dante goes beyond this.
For the sake of the heroism of Cato, he flatly
violates the theological categories which condemned
him to hell, and makes him the guardian of Purgatory.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
As for the rest of the ‘virtuous heathen,’
he cannot indeed transfer them from the hell to
which the Church has assigned them—a hell much
more ferocious than any of which they had dreamed—to
Elysium. But he does what he may, and he
provides for them within the precincts of hell an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
Elysium of green lawns and running streams, ‘the
one place in the Inferno where there is light and
air’ (<i>Inf.</i> iii). The theological ethic of sin is thus
unconsciously crossed, again and again, by the
poetic ethic for which ‘good’ means greatness of
soul.</p>

<p>Moreover, with a depth of spiritual insight
strangely in contrast with the vulgar notion of
punishment which dictated the theological hell,
Dante has asserted, even in this realm of iron
necessity, the freedom of man. The inmates of
hell are not convicts condemned and punished for
sins long since repented of: they are there of their
own motion and by their own will; and if there
is no hope there, it is not because God has no
mercy, but because they cannot repent. The souls
in Purgatory are held there by no compulsion;
they desire nothing but to be purified of their
sins, and the moment they desire to mount to
Paradise, that moment they are free.</p>

<p>It would be strange, then, had Dante, with all
his sense of supreme cosmic forces, not stood for
the faith that man is yet the ‘captain of his soul.’
There he is at one with Æschylus and Milton,
and the other great theological poets of the West.
Man’s ‘freedom’ is a root idea of the Comedy;
and not merely because its purpose was to show
him ‘in the exercise of freewill,’ determining his
fate hereafter. Dante went much farther than
this. A devoted Catholic and citizen, and eager
to welcome the authority both of Church and State,
he was driven by the corruption of the one and the
anarchy of the other to seek ‘another way’—the
way of spiritual self-help with the aid of philosophy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
and theology, along which he is led by Vergil and
Beatrice. The great farewell words with which
Vergil leaves him in the Earthly Paradise, ‘I
crown and mitre thee king and bishop over thyself,’
express with thrilling power the individualist—nay,
the revolutionary—side of his thought.
He would not have been the great poet he was
if it had been the only side. Dante’s reverence
for Vergil and for Beatrice is of the very substance
of his self-assertion; he has crowned and mitred
himself by taking them for his guides, and the
result is the great poetic cosmos eloquent beyond
all the other masterpieces of the world of devout
discipleship, and yet instinct in every line with
the ardour of a soul ‘voyaging through strange
seas of thought alone.’</p>

<p>But the name of Beatrice points to another
aspect of Dante’s work on which the impress of
the poet in him is yet more unmistakably set.
Measured by the range and compass of thought,
and by the richness and delicacy of feeling, which
the term in his usage conveys, Dante is the first,
as he is the greatest, of the poets of Love. His
poetry recovers and renews, or at the least suggests
and recalls, all the varieties of intellectual and
emotional experience for which philosophy, religion,
and romance had, before his time, found in ‘Love’
the final expression, or the speaking symbol. The
cosmic love (φιλία) by which Empedocles had
first interpreted the universal phenomena which
we still, hardly less anthropomorphically, know as
‘attraction’; the passion for another human being
(ἔρως) in which the author of the <i>Phædrus</i> and the
<i>Symposium</i> discovered one of the sources of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
divine exaltation which emancipates men from
their human limits, and endows them with the
vision of reality; the love of God for man, and of
man for God (ἀγάπη), proclaimed as the very core
of Christianity in the Fourth Gospel—these three
types of love, all denoted for Dante by <i>Amor</i>,
<i>amore</i>,<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> were conjoined in his experience with a
fourth, distinct from all, though nearly allied to
the second: the romantic love of woman which
had been the chief inspiration of the poetry of
Provence, and which, however sublimated and
spiritualized, is enshrined in the <i>Vita Nuova</i>. To
say that Dante’s mind, equally powerful in analysis
and in synthesis, confounds these distinctions
would be unjust; but it would be equally untrue
to assert that their associations are never blended.
Christian philosophy had itself absorbed the first;
cosmic attraction then reappeared in a sublime
apotheosis, as the love which draws all the universe
towards God, and by which God, as its source,
‘moves the sun and the other stars.’ And if
Dante, in his treatise on poetry,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> distinguishes
himself from the poets of ‘love’ as a poet of
‘morals,’ or ‘righteousness,’ he also, as we saw,
ascribes his whole power as a poet to his writing
what love dictated in his heart. Man in virtue
of his freedom has power to misuse Love, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
Dante everywhere scornfully contrasts the higher
and the baser love. Nay, all sin which can be
‘purged away’ he regards as due to ‘love’ wrongly
used; the whole population of Purgatory is there
because it loved unwisely, or loved indifferent
things too well, or right things too little. But the
harm here, for Dante, arises not from love, but from
the application to it of the evil material in man’s
nature—‘as a foul impress may be set upon the
most precious wax.’<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Something of the idealizing atmosphere which
Christianity and Plato had thrown about love
thus always colours it in Dante’s mind. But it
is also subtly touched with that other idealizing
force which not Christianity but the poets had
recognized, which Christian ethics had contemptuously
tolerated or scornfully tabooed. Dante
had known the love of woman in many forms.
Longing for the absent wife and child had consumed
his flesh and his bones in exile;<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> and his
virginal adoration of Beatrice sprang from no
coldness of the blood. The power of womanhood
to lift men to supreme heights of vision and fortitude,
which he had divined through Beatrice and
sung in the great canzone of the <i>Vita Nuova</i>,<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> no
more passed out of his faith than did her image
from his memory. Nor was it for nothing that
his master Vergil had forgotten the political and
imperial purpose of his poem in making Dido the
most moving heroine of antiquity. If the Comedy
is a great scheme of salvation, it is also a great
song of womanhood such as, he said, no man ever
sang before; and if we say that Beatrice is there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
a symbol for Theology, that is doubtless true:
but a thousand phrases remind us how much she
symbolizes besides; and the look ‘in the eyes of
Beatrice,’ which draws Dante upward through the
circling spheres of Paradise to the beatific vision,
attests also his faith in the power of the lover’s
adoration to lift a man out of his humanity
(<i>trasumanar</i>), and make him ‘joyful even in the
flames.’</p>

<p>Thus Dante, though he counted himself not
among the poets of love, but among the poets of
‘righteousness,’ is one of the inspiring sources
of the modern poetry which invests the love of
man and woman with the ideal attributes which
philosophy and religion had proclaimed in other
forms of love, but had ignored or repudiated in
this. In Spenser—Platonist, Christian, and lover
at once—the fusion of the three strains is complete;
his great hymns to Love, who</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent10">is lord of all the world by right,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And ruleth all things by his powerful saw,</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">prelude his even greater hymn of marriage. Even
Chaucer perhaps learnt from Dante that amazed
awe with which, in the opening lines of one of his
earliest Italianate poems, he contemplates the
‘wonderful working’ of love.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> The Petrarchists
and Sonneteers went far to reduce the expression
of this love to hollow phrase-making. But with
Romanticism it found fresh and original utterance,
and its status in the world has never been more
loftily affirmed than by Celtic Romanticizing poets<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
of to-day. ‘I say that Eros is a being!’ declares
one of the finest spirits among them. ‘It is more
than a power of the soul, though it is that also.
It has a universal life of its own.’<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<h3>III</h3>

<p>The power of personality and the glory of love:
these have emerged from our discussion thus far
as the things in life whose appeal to poetic intelligence
was most potent in modifying the substance
or changing the perspective of a World-view derived
from religion. We have now to examine, in a
fashion unavoidably even more fragmentary and
summary, the reaction of another series of poetic
minds upon the more complex and abstruse World-views
of <i>philosophy</i>.</p>

<p>It is necessary for the purpose to adopt a rough
grouping of philosophic systems, and I take the
following division into three fundamental types,
based with qualifications upon one proposed by
Wilhelm Dilthey in the essay already referred to.</p>

<p>To the first belong the naturalistic schools, from
Democritus to Hobbes and the Encyclopedists,
deriving their philosophical conceptions directly or
indirectly from an analysis of the physical world,
and commonly disdaining or ignoring phenomena
not to be so explained. To the second type of
thinkers the objective world is still the absorbing
subject of contemplation; but it is approached not
from the side of physics, but from the side of self-conscious
mind; it is felt, not as material for
causal investigation, but as responsive to the human<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
spirit, now as living Nature, now as immanent
God, now as a progressively evolving Absolute.
Here, with various qualifications, we may class
Heraclitus, the Stoics, Spinoza, Leibniz, Hegel.
In the third type, the focus of interest and the
determining source of philosophic ideas is the
self-conscious mind itself. It feels profoundly its
own energy and power of self-determination; and
it regards the objective world not as deeply at one
with it, responsive to its feeling, accessible to its
thought, but rather as a threatening power against
which it must vindicate its spiritual freedom and
build its secure spiritual home. In the philosophies
of this type, personality—which the first
type ignored and the second reduced to an organ
of a world process—became the fundamental condition
of our experience, as with Kant and Fichte,
or a transcendent personal God shaping the universe
to his mind, as with the Plato of the <i>Timæus</i>.</p>

<p>If we now consider these three types in relation
to our problem, it seems evident that the second
and the third are naturally more congenial to
poetry than the first. Yet we know that one of
the greatest of Roman poets made it the work
of his life to expound the atomic Naturalism of
Epicurus to an unreceptive Roman world.</p>

<p>The naturalism of Democritus and Epicurus,
though framed purely in the interest of scientific
explanation, and hostile both to poetry and to
religion as commonly understood, was potentially
a great poetic discovery, the disclosure of a Worldview
wholly novel and of entrancing appeal to the
poetic apprehension. The sublime perspectives of
an illimitable universe, the permanent oneness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
underlying the changing shows of sense: these
were contributions of philosophy to a poetic outlook
of which no poet had yet dreamed, and which
it was reserved for the greatest of philosophic poets
to make explicitly his own.</p>

<p>But the new way which Lucretius was the first
to tread was not to be pursued. He had for many
ages no successors. His difficult conquest of poetry
from a mechanical system, designed to explain,
not to inspire, was only to be emulated by a poet
of combined intellectual and imaginative grasp
comparable with his own. On the whole, the
science and the poetry of Lucretius, after that
moment of intense incandescence, fell apart. Vergil,
who as a young man saw the rising of this magnificent
lonely star in the Roman firmament, and
of all his contemporaries perhaps alone understood
its significance, honoured the discoverer of the
causes of things, but his own philosophy was of
a cast easier to harmonize with the idealisms of
poetry. From the side of science, Gassendi and
the physicists of the seventeenth century valued
the Lucretian exposition of atomist theory as a
welcome supplement to the fragments of Democritus
and Epicurus. But before the nineteenth
century scientific materialism was never again allied
with great poetic power. The eighteenth century
saw an immense advance in the scientific reconstruction
of our beliefs about the world, but its
nearest approaches to the negations of Lucretius
were conveyed only in the prose of a D’Holbach
or a Hume, while its most brilliant English poet,
far from wrestling, like his friend Berkeley, with
the new spectre of materialism raised by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
triumphs of Newton, afforded himself and his
readers complete satisfaction by decorating the
easy harmonics of deism in the <i>Essay on Man</i>.
The immense quickening of imaginative power
which marked the decades immediately before
and after the close of the century widened the
chasm between poetry and any mechanical view
of the world. If at certain points (as in Shelley’s
and Coleridge’s early chemical ardour, and Goethe’s
momentous biological researches) poets make fruitful
approaches to science, it was because they
found in science itself an apparent release from
the mechanical point of view, a clue to their ultimate
faith (however differently expressed) in a
divine, benignant Nature. The recovery of imagination
told, in philosophy as in poetry, for the
most part, is a wonderful idealization of the
universe, culminating in Hegel’s evolution of
the Absolute and in Wordsworth’s awe before the
Mind of Man—conceptions which must be discussed
in a later section.</p>

<p>But in some very distinguished poetic minds
the recovery of imaginative power led to no
idealization of the world. It rather enabled them
to present with a peculiar poignant intensity a
world stripped bare of ideal elements, in which
goodness and hope are alike illusory, and Nature
is either a dead mechanism or a cruel, implacable
and irresistible alien Power. Leopardi, Schopenhauer,
Leconte de Lisle, and (on a lower plane)
James Thomson, were the most conspicuous examples
in the nineteenth century of poetic genius
(for Schopenhauer’s work is a colossal poem of
pessimism) absorbed in the contemplation of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
universe as denuded as that so passionately embraced
by Lucretius, of love or hope for man.</p>

<p>A situation analogous to that of Lucretius
arises, therefore, in their case. Their world offered
no foothold to the optimist: was it equally bare
of support for the poet? Bacon’s assertion that
poetry submits the shows of things to man’s
desires might imply that; but Bacon (who, incidentally,
thought slightly of Lucretius) ignores
the poetry born of a conviction that the shows
of things are finally unalterable by man’s desires,
and it is Leopardi, even more than Lucretius, who
has shown us how sublime the poetry which rests
on this lonely stoicism may be. One might even,
in certain moods, be tempted to attach a yet
higher value to the temper of this lonely heroism,
which faces a blankly hostile universe utterly
without support, than to that which exults in
conscious Oneness with a universe pervaded by
Love or Beauty, by benign Nature or God. The
loneliness of Prometheus is more moving as poetry
than his rapturous union with Asia. Why is this?</p>

<p>I take it that it is because the lonely Prometheus,
the heroic striver with a loveless world, makes us
more vividly aware of the Spirit of Man, and that
what moves us most in the great poetry is the
revelation of the Spirit of Man even more than
the revelation of the glory of the universe. We
have seen that these two are natural poles of poetic
faith, that is, conclusions upon which the thinking
of any poet who thinks as a poet, will tend to
converge; and if he is thwarted in the one aim
he will fall back with the more energy upon the
other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span></p>

<p>Now this vivid consciousness of spirit, whether
shown in heroism or in love, is ultimately inconsistent
with a creed which strips the universe of
all ideal elements; and where this is in possession,
undermines and disintegrates it. The ‘Everlasting
No’ yields ground to the Everlasting Yea; or negation
itself is impregnated with divinity, as when
Leconte de Lisle glories in his <i>néant divin</i>. To
imagine heroism intensely is to be convinced that
whatever else is illusory, heroism is not an illusion,
that the valour of man has a kinship and support
somehow, somewhere, in the nature of things.
And if heroism is not an illusion, human society
is no illusion either. For the heroic struggler with
infinite odds is no longer alone; the army of saints
and martyrs are with him; and it was the poet
for whom loneliness opened ways into infinity
beyond any companionship who cried to one such
heroic struggler, fallen in the fight—</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">And Love, and Man’s unconquerable mind.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>I propose to illustrate the working of the forces
which thus qualified a creed of negations, from
the impressive case of Leopardi.</p>

<p>In Giacomo Leopardi (1798-1837) we have a poet
in whom astonishing power and wealth of mind
were united to a complete rejection of the theological
and philosophical apparatus of consolation.
The mental revolution which left him in early
manhood entirely denuded of the beliefs in which
he had been reared, was final, and left no trace
of reaction or regret, of hesitation or doubt. An<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
absolute calm of secure conviction marks the entire
subsequent course of his short life. Few men
who have ‘found religion,’ once for all, have been
brought by it into an anchorage so secure from
inner or outer assault as this man who at twenty-two
discovered that religion was a dream.</p>

<p>With supernatural belief fell from him also every
form of secular faith and hope for man. Religion
was but one among the crowd of cherished illusions
which cheat men with the expectation of happiness.
Human happiness was always founded on illusion,
and the pursuit of it was therefore vain. Hence
all the organized energies of civilization, the activities
of business or politics, of science or art, of the
professions, of state administration, counted in his
eyes at best as distractions which blinded those
who engaged in them to the deadly vision of truth.
For himself these distractions and the relief they
brought were impossible, for he had seen the
truth; and the remorseless analysis which shattered
the basis of illusion on which they rested,
sapped the impulse to share in them. Of the
state, and the patriotisms which bind its members
together, he was as sceptical as Ibsen, without
sharing his idealizing homage to the man who
stands alone. In the <i>Storia del Genero Umano</i> he
makes Jove introduce the diversities of peoples
and tongues among men, seeds of emulation and
discord, and send forth among them the ‘phantoms’
known by the names of Justice, Virtue,
Glory, and Love of Country. ‘Humanity’ itself
was an illusory bond, and the ‘nations’ of the
world were ultimately its individual men.</p>

<p>Yet Leopardi does not denounce crime. Man is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
for him more unhappy than criminal; and his evil
qualities are to be laid to the charge of the Nature
that made him. He is more sinned against than
sinning, and Leopardi’s profound pity, if often
derisive and scornful, never passes into invective.
His passionate upbraidings of his countrymen in
the boyish canzone <i>Italy</i>, like his ardent aspiration
after national glory for his country and poetic
fame for himself, disappear from the melancholy
calm of the <i>Bruto Minore</i> and the <i>Ginestra</i>.</p>

<p>Yet the effect of Leopardi’s work—and especially
of his poetry—is at many points subtly to rectify
his desperate view of the world. He cannot suppress
the uprush of pity for those whose career
in it is prematurely cut short, however his reason
may persuade him that they are fortunate.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> The
noble pathos of the Attic grave monuments, representing,
for instance, a young girl in the act of
taking leave of her friends, overpowers the reflections
of his philosophy, and he wrestles in moving
verses with the enigma:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent8">Ah me! why at the end</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Of paths so grievous, not ordain at least</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A happy goal? But rather robe in gloom</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And terror that for which through life</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">We long as the sole refuge from our woes,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And show us, yet more dread than the stormy sea,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The port we make for?</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>A portrait of a beautiful woman, carved also
upon her tomb, overwhelms him with the wonder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
of beauty and the paradox of its conversion into
dust:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Ah, human nature, how,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If utterly frail thou art and vile,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If dust thou art and ashes, is thy heart so great?</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If thou art noble in part,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">How are thy loftiest impulses and thoughts</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">By so ignoble causes kindled and put out?<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Not less acutely he feels the paradox of artistic
creation. Like Abt Vogler he contemplates the
‘palace of music’ reared by the performer’s hand:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Desires infinite</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And visions sublime</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">It begets in the kindled thought, ...</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where along a sea of delight the spirit of man</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ranges unseen, as some bold swimmer</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">For his diversion the deep....</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>But a single discord shatters this paradise in a
moment. Abt Vogler’s creation is not shattered;
he has played to the end, and put the last stone
in its place. But it has vanished, and he calls in,
to save it, his high doctrine of the eternity of
created beauty. Leopardi has no such faith, and
he puts the doctrine to a severer test by dissolving
the spell of beauty before it is complete. Yet he
feels as acutely as Browning the marvel of the
musical creation, and that its abrupt dissolution
does not cancel the significance of its having been
there at all. He does not openly confess that
significance, but it stirs in him a tormenting sense
of anomaly.</p>

<p>He comes nearer to such confession when he
speaks of love. His own experience of love was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
that of a virginal passion; the ideal exaltations
which make every lover something of a poet had
their way in this great poet unclouded by vulgar
satiety. He knows well enough that love arrays
the woman, for the lover, in ideal charms not her
own; but instead of lamenting or deriding this
illusion, as illogically he should have done, he
glories in it. Love, like music, ‘reveals the mystery
of unknown Elysiums,’<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> but these ‘lofty images’
are accessible only to the man; woman cannot
understand them; for such conceptions there is
no room in her narrow brow. The stern derider
of illusions has here no praise for the sex which
sees things as they are: the unconscious idealist
in Leopardi takes the side of the ‘illusions.’</p>

<p>And his way of speaking about Love elsewhere
is less that of the pessimist philosopher than of
the Platonist poet who sees in it a clue to real
vision. The pessimist in him does full justice to
the havoc wrought in the world in Love’s name;
but after the gods had watched the working of the
lower love, their cynical gift, Jove sent down
another Love, ‘child of Venus Urania,’ in pity of
the noble hearts who were worthy of it, yet rarely
permitting even to them the happiness it brings
as ‘surpassed in too small a measure by that of
heaven.’<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Love above all else irradiates the waste
of life, it is ‘the source of good, of the highest joy
found in the ocean of existence’; it alone holds
equal bliss for man with Death, which for ever allays
his ills. ‘Love and Death’ are twin brothers, and
the fairest things on the earth or under the stars.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
Even the memory of love can make ‘abhorred old
age’ endurable, and send a man willingly to the
scourge or the wheel, as the face of Beatrice could
make her lover ‘happy in the flames.’<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Hence
Love makes the heart ‘wise,’ for it inspires men
with the contempt of life:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘For no other lord do men face peril</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With such alacrity as for him.’</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where thou dost help, O Love, courage is born</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Or wakens; and, against its wont, mankind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Grows wise in action, not lost in idle thought.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is not the language of pessimism; and this
‘wisdom’ inspired by love, which reconciles men
to courageous death, is something quite other
than the calculation that death is a release from
life’s ills. That is the suicide’s wisdom, not the
hero’s. Leopardi’s conception of Love has taken
up nobler elements than his pessimism could
supply; he describes a Triumph of Love over
Death, not a shrewd perception that Death is the
easiest way out, or even a blessed port after stormy
seas.</p>

<p>Yet Love in its noblest form was given, he knows,
but to few; and he himself had known it only as
a fleeting experience. He knew as a continual
possession, on the other hand, his own intellectual
nature, the sovran thought which stripped off the
illusive shows of things and disclosed to him the
naked horror of reality undisguised, but filled him
none the less with the exultation of power, and the
lofty joy which belongs to discovery even of a tragic
truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span></p>

<p>Such exaltation finds its most powerful expression
in the great hymn to ‘Thought the Master.’ His
restless and piercing intellect was a double-edged
instrument. It was not the source of his pessimism,
but it furnished the remorseless analysis of the
glories and shows of life which gave its air of
inevitable logic to his temperamental despair. Yet
the exercise of the instrument was itself a vivid
joy, and, like love, created for the wielder a lonely
earthly paradise within the vast waste of this
earthly hell.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> There he wanders, in an enchanted
light, which blots out his earthly state; thither
he returns from the dry and harsh converse with
the world as from the naked crags of the Apennines
to a joyous garden smiling afar. Is this
‘terrible but precious gift of heaven’ also an
illusion? Perhaps; but it is one ‘by nature
divine,’ and capable of possessing us with the
secure tenacity of truth itself, as long as life
endures.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>In any case it created for him definite and wonderful
values in the world which detracted dangerously
from the consistency of his faith in the world’s
fundamental badness. ‘Thought’ was the only
civilizer; by thought mankind had actually risen
out of their primeval barbarism;<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> it was the
sole agent in advancing the public welfare. His
towering disdain for the frivolity and utilitarianism
of his own age sprang from no mere excess of
self-esteem; it was the scorn of one whom ‘thought’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
had lifted to a standpoint of ideal excellence beside
which all alien impulses seemed intolerable.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> It
armed him with a magnanimity which the sight of
any cowardly or ignoble act stung to the quick,
which laughed at danger or at death,<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> which could
endure with resolute Stoicism and antique valour
the passage through the miseries of life.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>But thought had its peculiar joys also, less
equivocal than these. It fed on the sublimity
even of the desolate world, on the loneliness of
nature, on the infinity of the starry depths. In
the lines on ‘The Infinite’ he describes a favourite
haunt—a lonely hill, from which the horizon is on
all sides cut off. ‘There I sit and gaze, fashioning
in thought boundless distances, superhuman
silences, and profoundest rest.... In this immensity
my thought is drowned, and shipwreck in
that ocean is a joy.’</p>

<p>And converse with thought gives him, too, the
vision of ideal beauty—a vision which quickens
the ecstasy of his most rapturous moments. It is
no pallid dream; the fairest face he meets seems
but a feigned image of its countenance, a derivative
streamlet from the one sole source.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> That
ideal beauty is his lady, but he had never seen
her face, for nothing on the earth is like her, or
were it like in feature, or in voice, it would be
less in beauty.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Leopardi is here very near to
Shelley. The visionary ideal of beauty and love
was not less vividly present to him; but the sterner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
temper of his pessimism was less easily persuaded
that it had projected itself into the being of any
earthly Emilia. The ‘Intellectual Beauty’ of
Shelley’s hymn had its seat and stronghold in a
like glow of inner vision, but its ‘awful loveliness’
was more abundantly hinted or disclosed in the
world of nature and of man, giving ‘grace and
truth to life’s unquiet dream,’ and luring the
sensitive poet on to the pursuit of a thousand
fugitive embodiments of its eternal essence. Leopardi’s
language, marmoreally clear-cut and austere,
seems to bear the impress of a mind powerfully
self-contained, exempt from all seductions of
the senses, even of colour and melody, calm with
the resolution of despair. Shelley’s language, dissolving
form and outline in an ethereal radiance,
seems the mirror of a self-diffusive genius which
saw all things through the veil of its own effulgence.
Leopardi has been called ‘the most classical
of the romantics’; Shelley was in some sense
the very soul of romanticism. But as this very
comparison implies, the romantic temper glowed
in both. In both, the long travail of existence
was crossed by the exultations of the visionary
and the idealist. With Leopardi, martyred in
his prime by painful disease, the gloomy shades
closed in more and more impenetrably upon the
world of man and nature, and death was happy
because it was the end of life. With Shelley the
universe grew more and more visibly transfigured
by a spirit deeply responsive to his own; all things
worked and moved in beauty, and were woven
through and through with love. In Leopardi’s
more tenacious intellect the negations of a corroding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
criticism were less easily overcome. But
nature, which had armed his brain with that
corroding criticism flung across it also the rapturous
delight in beauty, in love, in the creative
energy of thought itself, and there were moments
when poetry transported him beyond the iron
limits of his creed, to the belief that love and
beauty and thought are neither illusory nor the
sources of illusion, but signs and symptoms of an
ideal reality.</p>

<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The poetry of negations strives instinctively
towards fuller affirmation: that is the purport of
our survey hitherto. We have seen in a previous
essay how Lucretius the poet saw this mechanical
universe through a transfiguring atmosphere of
passion and pathos, attachment, regret, not dreamt
of in his philosophy.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> And there are signs enough
that had that philosophy admitted, what it fiercely
denied, those ideas of a living and personal or
even divine Nature, or of a universe pervaded
by God, which respond to poetic apprehension at
the point where the Epicurean naturalism left it,
as it were in the lurch, he would have eagerly
embraced them.</p>

<p>Now it was precisely those ideas of life and
personality present in Nature, or even pervading
the universe, which prevailed among philosophic
thinkers of the <i>second type</i>, who inquired (to put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
it in the roughest way) not how the world might
have come about, but what it meant. For the
answer, infinitely varied in its terms, uniformly
postulated that the idealism of man reflected
something answering to it in the very nature of
reality. Two profound suggestions towards an
ideal conception of the world, thrown out by the
genius of Greece, could still intoxicate the intellect
of early nineteenth-century Germany:—the Heracleitean
idea of the harmony of opposites, and the
Platonic and Stoic doctrine of the soul of the
world. Of the first I say nothing more here;
for Heracleitus, pregnant as his dark sayings are
with poetry, has never had his Lucretius.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> The
doctrine of a world-soul, on the other hand, has
again and again helped poetry to articulate her
rapturous apprehension of the glory of the world.
For European speculation, at least, the conception
had its origin in the <i>Timæus</i>, where the last perfecting
touch of the divinely-appointed artificer
who constructs the world is to give it a ‘soul’
and make it ‘a blessed god.’</p>

<p>In the pantheism of the Stoics, the idea of a divine
world-soul set forth in this grandiose myth became
a radical dogma, one of the chief sources of their
significance as an intellectual and moral force.
At Rome the Stoic pantheism softened the rigour
of national and social distinctions. The humanity
of the Roman law lies in the direct line of its
influence. In the mind of the most sensitive and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
tender of Roman poets, on the other hand, the
Stoic idea fell upon a soil rich in qualities uncongenial,
if not unknown, to its native habitat.
Stoic thought in Vergil, no less than Epicurean
in Lucretius, has taken the colour of that richer
soil. The sublime verses which he puts in the
mouth of Anchises have riveted this solution, if
such it be, of the world-riddle upon the mind of
posterity; but the real contribution of Vergil is
less in any expressive phrase or image than in the
diffused magic of a temperament in which all subtle
and delicate attachments wonderfully throve;
where, more than in any other Roman mind, the
‘threefold reverence’ of Goethe, the reverence for
what is above us, for what is below us, and for
our fellow-men, found its congenial home.</p>

<p>And it is not hard to see how sheer poetic instinct
drew him this way. His two great masters in
poetry, Homer and Lucretius, had inspired and
helped to mould a genius fundamentally unlike
either. The majestic pageant of the Olympians
was not at bottom more consonant to his poetry
than the scorn which tramples on all fear of divinity
and puts the roar of Acheron under its feet. The
Jupiter and Venus and Juno and Pallas who so
efficiently order the changing fortunes of Æneas
are but a splendid decoration, like the Olympian
figures in Raphael’s frescoes at the Farnesina.
And well as he understands the bliss of the triumphant
intellect, of Man become the master of
things, he is himself content with the humbler
joys of one who has acquaintance with Pan and
the Nymphs, with the gods of the woodland and
the fountain-spring. These were real for him, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
it may be with the matter-of-fact reality of the
senses, but as speaking symbols of something more
deeply interfused, less articulate than man, but
more articulate to man’s spirit than the fountains
or the flowers.</p>

<p>The great pantheistic phrases of Vergil have
echoed, we know, throughout the after-history of
poetry. We might even be tempted to say that
pantheism, in some sense, must be the substance
of any ‘poetic view of the world.’ But if so, it
must be a pantheism which owes at least as much
to the entranced intuition of the poets as to the
abstract thinking of philosophy. Their ecstasy of
the senses, their feasting joy in the moment, and
in the spot, have enabled them not merely to
express the creed of pantheism with greater freshness
and sincerity, but to give it interpretations
and applications of which theoretic speculation
never dreamed. We should not prize the great
lines of <i>Tintern Abbey</i> so far above the eloquent
platitudes of the <i>Essay on Man</i> if we did not feel
that Pope was merely putting philosophy at second-hand
into brilliant verse, while Wordsworth had
not only reached his thought through his own
impassioned contemplation, but actually given it
a new compass and profundity not attainable by
any logical process. He found his ‘something
more deeply interfused’ as he looked with emotion
too deep for tears upon the humble flower and the
simple village child, or remembered the experiences
of his own wonderful boyhood; and these were
for him not merely portions of a body of which
God was the soul, but themselves luminous points,
or running springs, of spiritual light and life. So<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
that if his poetry touches doctrinal pantheism
(which he never names) at one pole, at the other
it is nearer to the spiritual fetishism of St. Francis’s
hymns to Brother Sun and Brother Rain.</p>

<p>It is easier to distinguish definite philosophic
ideas at work in the poetic apprehension of Shelley.
We know in any case that they played an immensely
greater part in his intellectual growth.
Plato and Dante have helped him to those wonderful
phrases in which he seeks to make articulate
his rapturous cosmic vision of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">

    <div class="verse indent0">That light, whose smile kindles the universe,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Burns bright or dim as each are mirrors of</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The fire for which all thirst.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noin">That is his rendering, translated out of theological
terms, of the sublime opening lines of the <i>Paradiso</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The glory of Him who moves the whole, penetrates through
the universe and is reflected in one part more and in another less.</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">But, even so, Shelley is feeling through these
great words—Light, Love, Beauty—towards something
which none of them can completely convey.
And in this Shelleyan ‘love’ itself, the subtle
distinctions carried out, as we saw, by Dante
disappear even more completely than the dramatic
play of thought in the <i>Symposium</i> disappears in
the suffused splendour of Spenser’s <i>Hymns</i>. In
logical power Shelley was as little to be compared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
with Dante as Spenser with Plato. Yet some
distinctions seem to assert themselves even in
that ecstatic love-interwoven universe of his. His
poet’s intense consciousness of personality sounds
clear through the pantheistic harmonies. When he
is trying to utter as he sees it the sublime paradox
of the dead but deathless poet, he falls successively,
heedless of inconsistency, upon symbols drawn from
the dogmas of antagonistic schools of thought.
Pantheism, individual immortality, heaven, Elysium—he
draws upon them all, but none suffices.
The dead poet is made one with Nature, becomes
a part of the loveliness which once he made more
lovely; his voice is heard in the nightingale’s
song. But he is also an individual soul, who has
passed at death to the abode where the Immortals
are, and is welcomed there by Chatterton and
Sidney and Lucan and the rest. A cognate depth
and reach of apprehension has perplexed the
discoverers of contradiction in <i>In Memoriam</i>.
‘For the poets,’ aptly comments Mr. Bradley,
though he is thinking chiefly of Shelley and Tennyson,
‘the soul of the dead in being mingled with
nature does not lose its personality; in living in
God it remains human and itself.’<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<p>In comparison with the magnificent audacities
of pantheism and cosmic love, the philosophic
conception of ‘Nature’ has enjoyed the position
of a great authoritative commonplace, by invoking
which the most mediocre poet could dignify and
quicken his verse. It belonged to science as much
as to poetry, and to the poetry of clarified good
sense by as good right as to that of childlike intuition.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
It could stand for the ideal of just expression
which Pope counselled the poet ‘first to
follow,’ as legitimately as, a century later, it was
to stand for the living presence of Beauty, of
whose ‘wedding’ with the soul Wordsworth
chanted the spousal verse, or as the teeming
creative energy whose infinity Faust sought vainly
to clasp. But even that Augustan ‘Nature’
gathered something from the quality of the minds
which pursued literary discipline by its light, and
no one doubts that in Wordsworth or in Goethe
the φύσις or <i>natura</i> of strictly philosophic speculation
was but the fecund germ of a poetic creation,
which, whether it answered to a cosmic reality or
not, answered to deep-seated and ineffaceable
instincts and needs of man. Only, if great and
original genius has set its hall-mark upon this
noble metal, the crowd of small poets have mixed
it with their feeble alloys. There is a Nature
which responds to the greatest and sublimest
aspirations of man, and one which answers to his
self-indulgent dreams; a Nature which is wedded
to his soul, and one which is but the casual mistress
of his light desires. If the term ‘poetical’
has a slightly derisive air, it is because a cheap
glamour, which disguises truth, so often replaces
the profound symbol which touches its core. A
truly ‘poetic’ World-view has at any rate nothing
to do with this second-rate romance.</p>

<p>Among the poetic ways of regarding <i>Nature</i>,
there are two types, the distinction between which
concerns us. It is shadowed forth in the two
images I borrowed just now from Wordsworth and
from <i>Faust</i>. We may feel Nature as intimately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
united to us, deep calling to deep. Or we may
feel it as something which eludes our clasp, but
holds us by the very appeal of its affinity to that
which is infinite in ourselves. The first type is
too familiar to be further discussed here. But the
second, or Goethean type, needs a few words.</p>

<p>For it was with Goethe that a new and powerful
philosophic influence tardily entered modern
poetry—the influence of Spinoza. A quarter of
a century before Wordsworth and Coleridge were
overheard talking of him at Nether Stowey, Spinoza
had found deep springs of sympathy in the young
Goethe. A vivid passage in <i>Dichtung und Wahrheit</i>
(Book XIV) tells us that what especially fascinated
him was ‘the boundless unselfishness that glowed
in every sentence,’ and notably that ‘strange
sentence’ which later suggested a famous retort
of his Philine—‘He who loves God must not expect
that God shall love him in return.’<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Spinoza’s
God meant, roughly, the infinity of Nature, and
to love God meant to see all things in the light
of that infinity. Such a dictum therefore cut at
the root of the whole body of poetry which asserted
an answering spirit in Nature, from the self-indulgent
dreams of romantic sentiment to the
love-interwoven universe of Dante or Shelley.
The grandeur of Spinoza’s conception is apparent
enough even in his geometrical formulas, but
Goethe’s intense intuition translated it into human
experiences which stir us to the depths. The
Erdgeist’s retort to Faust—‘Du gleichst dem Geist
den du begreifst, nicht mir’—is one of the most
thrilling in all poetry, not because it indulges all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
our wishes, nor yet because it baffles them, but
because the barrier it opposes to the intellect is
a gate to the imagination, and we step out into
a poetic apprehension of the infinity which our
formulas seek to capture in vain.</p>

<p>It is by a like suggestion of infinities beyond
our reach and untouched by our emotions that
he moves us in poems like <i>Das Göttliche</i> or <i>Die
Grenzen der Menschheit</i>, or the opening scene of
the Second Part of <i>Faust</i>, which insist with so lofty
a calm on our limitations. From these infinities,
if we wish to live and act, we must turn away,
and that is what, as a wise physician, Goethe
bids us do. The intolerable glory of the sun is
broken up for us in the many-hued rainbow, and
this refracted light must be the guide of our life.
But no one could see life there who had not himself
gazed on the glory of the sun, and while we read
Goethe’s words we evade the very limitations he
imposes, just as Shelley (in the great kindred
passage), by the very image which condemns life
as a dome of many-coloured glass, lifts us into
the ‘white radiance’ beyond. ‘A little ring
bounds our life,’ he says elsewhere, ‘and many
generations succeed one another on the endless
chain of their being.’ A little ring on an endless
chain—a ‘little life rounded with a sleep,’—that
way lies a poetry as great as that which comes
to the visionary Celt who sees ‘waving round every
leaf and tree the fiery tresses of that hidden sun
which is the soul of the earth.’<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>But that way, also, lies a poetry of Man, a poetry
which has its sustaining centre not in the cosmos,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
but in the soul. To refuse the easy assumption
of Nature’s comradeship in our sorrow, to resign
the cheap consolations of the ‘pathetic fallacy,’
may be the way not merely to resignation, or
Stoicism, but to an apprehension of the heights
and depths of the soul thrown back upon itself,
and fetching strength not from any outer power,
but from undreamed-of inner resources of its own.
When Wordsworth, in the grasp of a great sorrow,
puts aside the glamour of the poet’s dream, in
order to bear with fortitude ‘what is to be borne,’
he has taken a step towards that poetry. When
he finds in suffering ‘the nature of infinity,’ with
gracious avenues opening out of it to wondrous
regions of soul life, he has entered it.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<h3>V</h3>

<p>We have thus watched the modification of
naturalistic atomism, of pessimistic materialism,
and of the cosmic conceptions of ‘pantheism’ and
‘Nature,’ by the immediate intuition, the eager
senses, and the vivid soul-consciousness which
characterize the poetic apprehension. It remains
to glance, finally, at the relations of poetry with
that third type of philosophic system, in which
soul-consciousness itself has played the guiding
and master part.</p>

<p>It was with the assertion of the soul’s predominance
that European philosophy, in the full sense
of the word, began. When Socrates turned from
the cosmic speculations of the Ionians to found
his ‘thinking-shop’ at Athens, and chaffed Anaxagoras<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
for having put mind at the head of things
and then given it nothing to do, he was preparing
the way, we know, for the magnificent soul-sovereignty
established by the master of all idealists.
Plato set up a trenchant dualism between soul
and sense, and thrust the sense-world into a limbo
of disparagement from which, where his spell
prevailed, it never emerged. The body was the
soul’s prison; the sense cheated it with illusion
and dragged it down with base desires.</p>

<p>The Transcendentalists of modern Germany
established a soul-autocracy differently conceived,
and founded upon other postulates, but not less
absolute. Kant shattered the claims of <i>Verstand</i>,
but only to enthrone <i>Vernunft</i>; Fichte found
nothing real and nothing good that was not rooted
in heroic will; Schopenhauer built up a philosophy
of self-effacement and world-flight on the doctrine
that the will to live which tortures us is also the
malign indwelling energy of the world. And none
of them surpassed in calm audacity the claims
made for individual reason by Fichte’s English
contemporary, Godwin.</p>

<p>Speculation of this type was already allied to
poetry by the boldness of its ‘subjective idealism,’
and it might be expected that its points of fruitful
contact with poetry would be correspondingly
numerous. Yet this is hardly, on the whole, the
case. If Plato’s influence on poetry is hard to
measure, if Kant taught something vital to
Schiller, and Schopenhauer to Wagner, ‘subjective’
philosophers and poets in the main pursued their
common preoccupation with soul along paths which
rarely crossed. Each brought to the exploration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
of that marvellous mine a lamp of extraordinary
power; but they carried it into different regions,
surveyed them on different methods, and returned
with different results. Poets without any scientific
psychology have, in virtue of imaginative insight
into the ways of character, created a mass of
psychological material with which scientific psychology
has only begun to cope. It is only among
poetic portrayers of the second rank, such as
Jonson and the allegorists, that theoretic categories
of character have had any determining weight.
The supreme characters of literature are true
creations, creations that are at the same time
discoveries—pieces of humanity which exceed
Nature’s ‘reach,’ perhaps, but not her ‘grasp.’
Prometheus, Hamlet, Satan, Faust, permanently
enlarged the status of the human soul in our
common valuation of life. That ‘discovery of
Man’ which intoxicated the Renascence was preeminently
a discovery of the stature of man’s soul—‘how
noble in reason, how infinite in faculty,
... in action how like an angel, in apprehension
how like a god!’ but philosophic ideas hardly
touched the surface of either Shakespeare or
Marlowe, and they furnished but one strand in
the woof of the mind of Milton.</p>

<p>In the English poetry of the time of Wordsworth
there is more affinity to philosophic ideas, but
their actual influence is apt to be strongest just
where the poetry itself is least intense. In a
very luminous lecture Mr. Bradley has traced the
relation between the two movements.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> An exalted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
faith in soul possessed and inspired both, but each
was in the main unconscious of the other. In the
poetry of his own countryman, Schiller, Kant’s
austere ideas reappear transformed in the crucible
of the poet’s livelier emotions or quicker sense of
beauty. Coleridge drank as deeply of Kantian
and cognate ideas, but only when the brief chapter
of his creative poetry was all but closed; while the
magnificent prose-poem in which Carlyle conveyed
the philosophy of Fichte-Jean-Paul-Teufelsdröckh
stands alone. What Wordsworth may have drawn
through Coleridge’s talk is not clearly distinguishable
from the original bent of his own mind.
The two streams ran courses largely parallel, but
in distinct though adjacent valleys. With Godwin’s
ideas, on the other hand, both Wordsworth, Blake,
and Shelley had stood in close intellectual relations.
And these were precisely the men whose poetry set
the deepest impress upon their view of life.</p>

<p>Is it possible by the help of either the parallel
or the derivative relationship to lay down any
common features in the process?</p>

<p>In the first place, the stress on the exaltation
of spirit is shifted by the poets, and with great
emphasis, from ‘reason,’ the instrument of philosophy,
to imagination. Reason is constantly not
merely ignored but openly slighted. It is not
what they mean when they exalt ‘mind.’ When
Wordsworth tells us, in the great <i>Recluse</i> passage,
of the awe, beyond Empyrean or Erebus, with
which he contemplated ‘the mind of man’; when
he sees the heroic devotion of the fallen Toussaint
perpetuated in ‘man’s inconquerable mind’; when
he encourages those who doubted Spanish heroism<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
with the sublime assurance that ‘the true sorrow
of humanity consists in this: not that the mind
of man fails, but that the course and demands of
life so rarely correspond with the dignity and
intensity of human desires’;—by this ‘mind’ he
means imagination, passion, heroic will, but not
discourse of reason. Wordsworth, apprehending
soul with his poet’s intuition, apprehends it as he
knew it in himself. He saw it, therefore, as an
energy operating not through ‘meddling intellect’
but through vision and vision-illuminated will,
with open eye and ear for its indispensable associates,
and love as its core. The ‘soul’ whereby
alone the nations shall be great and free was
something in which the humblest peasant and the
simplest child had part, and in which the meanest
flower struck answering chords. It is not accident
that the soul-animated England of Wordsworth’s
ideal is so utterly unlike Hegel’s Prussian state.</p>

<p>In William Blake soul-autocracy became aggressive
and revolutionary, and the breach with reason,
philosophic or other, widened to a yawning gulf.
Whether he is declaring ‘the world of imagination
to be the world of eternity,’ scoffing at the nature-lover
who sees ‘with’ not ‘through’ the eye, or
affirming that ‘to generalize is to be an idiot’—(a
stupendous example of the procedure he derides)—he
stands for a poetry stripped bare of all that
allies it either to philosophy or to common sense.
His prophetic books adumbrate a grandiose poetic
metaphysic, a world-system framed to the postulates
of this denuded poetry. And Shelley’s
<i>Apology</i> enthrones imagination as the creator and
upholder of all civilization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span></p>

<p>Secondly, the poetic shifting of the stress, within
the domain of the autocratic soul, from reason
to imagination and feeling, told powerfully upon
the ethical ideals proclaimed by this group of
poets. It added fresh impetus to that disposition
to override or transcend external standards of
morality which is inherent in all vivid inner consciousness.
Moral distinctions fade in the inner
illumination of the mystic. We have seen hints
of such a ‘transvaluation of ethical values’ disarranging
the iron categories of Dante’s Hell.
Applied to Hamlet or Othello, the traditional
categories of good and evil break in our hands.
Milton’s heroic devil, and the lovers whom Browning
scorns for being saved by their sloth from
crime, still perplex the moralist. But the poets
of the Revolution are openly sceptical of morality.
Of Shelley I need not speak. Even Wordsworth
makes a hero of a murderer. And Blake first
proclaimed explicitly, a century before Nietzsche,
a good ‘beyond good and evil,’ and figured the
inauguration of this transcendent ethic in the
colossal symbolism of his Marriage of Heaven and
Hell.</p>

<p>In all these writers, it is true, their attitude to
morality was in part derived from the bias towards
emancipation then current in all departments of
ethical, social, and political life, and had no relation
to specifically poetic apprehension. ‘Freedom’
was an ideal for Godwin and for Robespierre, as
well as for Shelley and for Kant, and was pursued
by them with equal devotion in their several
fashions. But they all, also, understood it in the
light of their several preoccupations. With Godwin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
as with Robespierre, it is mainly negative; with
Shelley, as with Kant, it acquires positive substance
and content. And this is because both
philosopher and poet see it as the means to some
perfection of the soul. The soul-autocracy of the
age, extravagant as it might be, is seen at its
noblest in the Kantian freedom won through
duty, and in the Shelleyan freedom won through
Love. The Kantian ideal of freedom interpreted
in that last conclusion of Goethe’s wisdom—‘He
alone is free who daily wins his freedom anew’—has
passed into the very substance of the strenuous
German mind. The Shelleyan ideal is of a rarer
but also of a more perilous stuff, and has touched
no such chords in the English character as his
music has stirred in the English ear. But something
of the genius of both ideals was gathered up
and concentrated in Wordsworth’s great affirmation
of the meaning of national freedom.</p>

<p>Wordsworth’s sense of law corrects what is
anarchic in Shelley, as Shelley’s flame-like ardour
corrects what is prosaic and common in Wordsworth.
Together they present more purely than
any of their contemporaries the noble substance
of a poetic ethic. In that poetic ethic the greatest
word, rightly understood, is still the Shelleyan
Love.</p>

<p>And it may be that if there is any ideal which,
springing from poetic apprehension, is yet fit,
rightly interpreted, for the common needs of men,
it is that ‘love of love’ on which Tennyson, so
far always from the revolutionary temper either in
love or poetry, set his finger in his early prime,
as the sovereign endowment of the poet. Only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
it must be love wide enough to include every kind
of spiritual energy by which the soul, transcending
itself, fulfils itself, and exerts, whether upon men
or nations, its liberating and uplifting power: the
love which creates, and the love which endures;
the love which makes the hero or the artist, and that
which spends itself inexhaustibly on a thankless
cause; the impersonal ardour of the mind, which
Spinoza called the ‘intellectual love of God,’ and
the impassioned union of souls, which to some
has seemed a clue to the vision of reality, and to
others the surest pledge of a future life; the love
of country which distinguishes the true service of
humanity from a shallow cosmopolitanism; and
the love of our fellow men, which distinguishes
true patriotism from national greed. To have had
no mean share in sustaining this large ideal of the
‘soul’ which makes us free is an enduring glory
of the poets.</p>

<p>Nor is this strange if, as I trust this partial
survey may have served to suggest, the spiritual
energy transcending itself, for which Love is the
most adequate name, be the core of the World-view
towards which, from their various religious
or philosophic vantage-grounds, a number of poetic
master-spirits have made an approach. Whether
they have found it as a light kindling the universe,
like Dante and Shelley; or as a creative power
shadowed forth in the eternal new birth of all
things, like Lucretius; or as the will and passion
of the human soul, heroically shaping its fate,
and divining its infinity most clearly when most
aware of its limitations, like Goethe; in some form
the faith that spiritual energy is the heart of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
reality was the centre towards which they knowingly
or obscurely strove. Such a faith, I suggest,
will be found to be a vital constituent of every
view of the world reached by a poet through his
poetic experience, and the main contribution of
that rich, profound, and intense form of experience
to man’s ultimate interpretation of life.</p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG&#8482;

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
